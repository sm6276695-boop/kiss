(Huo Mansion)

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.170
(Huo Mansion)

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.040
Today,

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.140
our hunt outside the Palace

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.520
is not only to display

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.150
the valor of the men of Han

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.760
but also to safeguard the peace
and stability of the realm.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.010
You must stay vigilant at all times,

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.300
protect His Majesty without fail,

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.820
and ensure that nothing goes amiss

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.090
on this hunt.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.430
Yes.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.730
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.070
Your Majesty.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.150
A minister is plotting treason.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.000
Rest assured.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Xiahou.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.650
I'm well aware.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.380
Just stay in the Palace.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.340
Wait for my triumphant return.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.370
Farewell, Your Majesty.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.840
Set out.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.520
Gentlemen.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.710
Regarding recent matters
about His Majesty,

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.280
I trust you've all heard some of it.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.420
It's been nearly a month
since His Majesty ascended the throne.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.460
Yet,

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.630
his conduct has been muddled and unwise,

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.420
showing no regard for laws or rituals.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.580
In my opinion,

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.570
he is not fit to shoulder the burden

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.710
of safeguarding the Han.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.440
Gentlemen.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.200
Do you agree with this?

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.870
His Majesty has indeed acted recklessly.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.980
Gentlemen.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.750
Since ancient times,

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.190
young Emperors,

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.400
without strict guidance,

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.430
often show improper conduct.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.430
As his ministers,

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.560
we must risk our lives to advise him,

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.150
reason with him earnestly,

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.240
and move him with sincerity.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.750
Even a child can be taught.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.470
How much more so a ruler?

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.910
The sovereign

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.910
is the master of all under heaven,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.360
holding the rank of supremacy,

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.460
standing above all people.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.960
As his subjects,
how could we lecture him at will?

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.120
If someone must guide him,

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.320
none would be more fitting
than Great General Huo.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.040
What Lord Fan says is true.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.800
Great General Huo
has given his all for the Han.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.340
Who can stand on equal ground with him?

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.110
Moreover, Lord Huo supported His Majesty

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.580
to ascend the throne.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:56.950
His Majesty is still young,

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.030
and Lord Huo has the right
to guide and nurture him.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:11.470
Now,

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:12.640
the Court

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.000
is clouded with chaos and discord,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.720
and the realm stands
on the brink of ruin.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.570
As descendants

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.870
receiving imperial grace,

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.120
we hold lofty ranks

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.630
to safeguard the realm
for generations to come.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.800
If the Han's foundation

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.130
should now collapse,

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.370
how could we still face the late Emperor

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.100
in the afterlife?

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.960
Today,

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:33.890
we must make a decision.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.000
Those who refuse or respond last

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.980
must not blame me

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.730
for showing no mercy.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:50.590
Lord Huo,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.160
we've all given our utmost for the Han.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.680
If we wish to secure the realm,

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.050
we will follow your lead

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.070
until we die.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.680
How understanding of Lord Xiahou.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.270
Good.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.830
If you all trust me

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.560
and still wish to stand with me,

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.930
serving the Han together,

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.000
then tonight,

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.470
you shall go with me
to the Changle Palace.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.890
We swear to defend the Han to the death!

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:24.590
Let's go.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.430
The Great General did

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.730
exactly as Lord Wang

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.040
predicted.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.760
So, how should we respond to this?

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:46.350
Follow the old precedent.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.370
We side with whoever wins in the end.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.400
Let's watch and decide later.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.840
Lord Huo.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.200
As for the bandits outside the city...

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.820
Zhang Sheng has taken control
of the armory

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.380
and led all troops
to sweep the bandits out.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.760
Wucheng Village will be taken care of.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:12.750
Lord Huo,

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.090
how should we draft the decree
to depose the Emperor?

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.430
We are following proper rites.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.600
Rulers abandoned
by heaven and the people

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.360
have always been those who lost virtue.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.630
We'll word the decree the same way

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.560
as the history books portray them.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.070
Besides,
His Majesty has been utterly absurd.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.270
(Having just finished the discussion,)

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.480
(Huo Guang, Great General,)

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.570
(leading Yang Chang, Prime Minister,
Zhang Anshi, General of the Chariots,)

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.220
(Tian Yannian, Minister of Agriculture,)

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.760
(Han Zeng, Front General, Zhao Chongguo,
Rear General, and other ministers,)

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.360
(headed toward the Changle Palace)

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:49.120
(to invite the Empress Dowager
to take charge.)

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.680
(Wucheng Village)
(Meanwhile, the warriors here)

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.010
- (also began their move.)
- Warriors, listen.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:55.330
Today's battle

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.850
is not for our own gain, honor, or shame

00:06:58.810 --> 00:06:59.760
but to safeguard

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.300
the bloodline of Crown Prince Wei.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.160
Despite the shadow
of the witchcraft calamity,

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.700
the fire of justice still burns

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.120
across the land.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.430
As the former forces
of Crown Prince Wei,

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.350
we must repay his past kindness

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:15.560
by seizing this chance

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.320
when Liu He is to restore order
in the Court

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.090
and help the Crown Prince's grandson,
Liu Bingyi, restore his honor.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:21.660
Then we can all be free from hardship.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:22.970
No more hiding to survive.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.300
This chance must not slip away.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:25.430
- Sure.
- Sure.

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:28.020
Set out.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.040
- Sure.
- Sure.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.800
- Sure.
- Sure.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.280
Everything will be fine.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.390
I have made up my mind.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.530
Today, Liu He will be deposed.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.610
As you wish,

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.120
I will issue the edict
to depose the Emperor.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.400
Good.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:12.780
I shall take my leave.

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:27.850
You heard it all.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:30.960
Your Majesty,

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:32.480
you gave your word...

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.060
There is a way to survive in the Palace.

00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:36.470
Those who defy it

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:38.960
always die soon in Chang'an.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:43.950
You and I are like sisters.

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.360
Go and tell His Majesty right now.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.340
I won't stop you.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:47.370
But if you're too late,

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.610
and His Majesty returns,

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:51.550
many matters will no longer be
in his hands.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:18.840
Father.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:19.720
Where are you going?

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:20.910
His Majesty is in danger.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.330
You mustn't go anywhere today.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:24.680
No.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.000
I must go today.

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:28.180
Have you forgotten
what you promised me before?

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.220
Don't go. There's unrest in the Palace.

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:34.630
This is reckless.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:42.720
Chang'an

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.390
is not as simple as you imagine.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:52.710
Guards.

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:55.400
Escort the lady to the carriage.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:28.160
This is a fine bow.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.400
We shall return with a full harvest.

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:32.330
- Let's go.
- Sure.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.160
- Wild boar!
- Where?

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:39.030
Right over there.

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:40.310
- Right there.
- Your Majesty.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.870
Huo Yu, won't you join us?

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:45.270
I dare not.

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:48.800
Today, you're my guard.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:49.740
Come on then.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:51.200
- Let's go.
- Yes.

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:53.960
We will surely return laden with game.

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:57.990
Hyah!

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:58.860
Your Majesty.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:10:59.840
Did it run this way?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.220
Why can't I see the wild boar?

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.450
Whoa.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.280
Go.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.000
Go! Hurry!

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:16.510
Hey.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:18.520
How did that wild boar run off so fast?

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.140
It's your fault. If you'd ridden faster,
we'd have caught up.

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:31.630
Protect His Majesty!

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:33.930
Who are you people?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.330
How dare you cause trouble here?

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.640
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.070
Welcome, Your Majesty.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.160
What is it, milord Xiahou?

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.590
The civil and military officials

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:11.210
are with Empress Dowager Shangguan.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.680
The Imperial City now stands empty.

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:14.200
The soldiers under Huo Guang's command

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.260
have been sent out
for bandit suppression.

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:19.320
This is the perfect moment
to take down Huo Guang.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.000
Go and seize them!

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.320
Bandit suppression?

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:24.920
Where to?

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.000
I heard it's Wucheng Village.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:28.110
Wucheng Village?

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:38.360
At last, you are all here.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.560
Zhang Sheng.

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:41.420
Wang Heng.

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:42.930
You plotted with the wandering heroes

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:43.850
to overthrow the Court.

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.970
By order of the Great General,
I've come to crush this rebellion.

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:48.360
Great General?

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:50.590
You've pledged allegiance to Huo Guang?

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.110
Five years ago,
I was ordered by Lord Huo

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.720
to stay hidden at His Majesty's side.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.060
During that time, I helped you a lot.

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:59.030
If you had acted with righteousness,

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:00.590
you wouldn't have ended up like this.

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:01.710
As it turns out,

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:03.960
you work for Huo Guang all along.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:04.850
Enough.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:06.920
You've committed
enough reckless follies.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.200
Those who act so foolishly
never meet a good end.

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:10.510
Look at Chen Shan.

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:12.010
Speaking of which,

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.470
- Chen Shan?
- I helped you on that.

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:14.550
Chen Shan is dead?

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:15.610
That's right.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.840
I killed him.

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:21.720
Nothing has changed.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.360
Not a single thing has changed.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.390
You even turned on one of your own.

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:31.200
He acted on his own
and ruined Lord Huo's plans.

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:32.120
He deserved it.

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:34.480
His fate will be yours as well.

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:35.630
Men!

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:37.750
Brothers!

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:39.200
Grab your weapons!

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.300
Go!

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.200
Li Qi, why is it you?

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:44.190
Zhang Sheng.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.030
Report to Lord Huo!

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:47.580
The people here have been replaced.

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:48.670
Tell Lord Huo to act now.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.240
Today, we've set a flawless trap.

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:53.680
Victory will be mine.

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:00.420
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:02.480
200 men from Wucheng Village
have arrived,

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:03.740
ready to follow your command.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:04.630
Please take care.

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:05.810
I'll lead the brothers ahead.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.670
I'm still worried

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:09.840
about the 200 men of mine.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:10.960
How about this?

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.090
You and De Jiu

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.510
escort them to Wucheng Village.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:15.630
What?

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:16.790
De Jiu.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.170
What do you think?

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:21.120
No.

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:22.240
Our victory hinges on this.

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:23.750
I must go with you.

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:28.980
Wang Heng, De Jiu, receive this decree.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.150
The men from Changyi
matter to the Court.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:38.960
As the Imperial Censor,

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.000
you must try your best

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:44.600
to escort them into Wucheng Village
with De Jiu.

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:46.410
I accept the decree.

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:55.080
I accept the decree.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.570
- Go at once.
- Yes.

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:01.590
Your Majesty.

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:03.840
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.870
Why not seize the moment
and bring down Huo Guang?

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:08.600
We mustn't.

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.210
If we make a move,

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.090
our brothers outside the city

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.390
will lose their lives.

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:15.240
Your Majesty.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.670
Is there anything more important
than the throne?

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.170
If they die for the throne

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:21.550
and the Han,

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:23.580
it will be an honorable death.

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:27.440
All who support you, including me,
have worked for this.

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:29.660
If not for yourself,

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:31.620
then at least think of us.

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:35.600
I'll go speak with Huo Guang.

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:37.680
Everyone can survive this way.

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:40.240
Your Majesty.

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:43.980
All Huo Guang wants is my throne.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.120
I can't just stand by
and watch everyone die.

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:48.830
If it comes to it, I'll give it to him.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.020
Your Majesty.

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:53.860
What's going on?

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:05.230
Your Majesty.

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:06.520
The Empress Dowager summons you.

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:08.040
Why?

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.190
I do not know.

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:11.170
(At this moment, Liu He)

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.800
(has realized the Mandate of Heaven
is about to unfold.)

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:16.630
(For the brothers in Wucheng Village,)

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:18.410
(he must go to negotiate.)

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:20.670
(The slowly closing gates)

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:21.830
(also signify)

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.760
(his 27-day reign as the Emperor)

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:26.600
(is about to end.)

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:53.520
