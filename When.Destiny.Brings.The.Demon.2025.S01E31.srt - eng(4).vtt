[When Destiny Brings The Demon]

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.500
[Based on the JJWXC novel "When Destiny Brings The Demon" by Fu Hua]

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.460
[Episode 31]
[The more we keep secrets, the more we look like a couple]

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.620
In tales of the supernatural,

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.450
fairies always love all living beings.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.140
But you're only devoted to me.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.860
You're devoted to one individual.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.700
Who exactly are you?

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.530
What's your goal?

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.170
What does Your Majesty think?

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.500
So beautiful, are you trying to bewitch me

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.220
and bring down my reign?

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.370
Does this face of mine really look so wicked?

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.340
Then you must want to use the dynasty's fortune to cultivate.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.340
But you chose me, a foolish emperor.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.780
I am no demon.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.300
Nor is Your Majesty a foolish emperor.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.340
I know you took the throne so young,

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.780
unable to rule in person.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.650
Many wished you harm, scheming for power.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.370
You only played the fool

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.370
to make your enemies drop their guard

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.060
and keep your throne secure.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.460
How could you possibly know this?

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.340
All Your Majesty needs to know is this:

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.850
No matter how many enemies surround you,

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.500
I will always stand by your side.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.690
This is how you slipped into my dreams, isn't it?

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.090
Your dreams?

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:23.780
Your Majesty has dreamed of me?

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.530
Since you so want to know my purpose,

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.850
then I shall tell you.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.530
We were once demon lovers,

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.500
our fates bound across three lives.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.690
But Your Majesty died too soon,

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.870
so I had to follow into the mortal realm

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.690
to find you again.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:05.810
What kind of demon lovers?

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.900
I was an otter, and Your Majesty was a black serpent.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.180
Absurd.

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:17.660
If it were true,

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.180
show me your true form.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.890
It's late. You still have morning court tomorrow.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.180
You should rest now.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.300
No rush. We have all the time in the world.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.210
Keep your words.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.500
Our days together are just beginning.

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:59.690
Mother was right:

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.010
trust your own heart.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.450
You two may go.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.890
I have matters to discuss. Please reveal yourself, Madam.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.300
So you've received my little gift.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.740
Yes. News just came from the prison.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.420
Wei Xianyu is dead.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.660
Then will you join hands with me?

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.370
Of course.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.450
I am willing to work with you,

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:18.770
each of us getting what we need.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.130
I've also heard

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.180
that demon lady was wounded at the banquet.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.690
That must have been your doing.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.210
More than just wounded.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.740
I've planted a trace of my aura

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.370
in her demon core.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.890
It will flare up bit by bit.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.010
Fed by the grudges of men,

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.010
her core will swell.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.330
Once it's out of control, she'll help us

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.690
kill Sima Jiao.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.420
Your Majesty, this incense soothes the mind

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.420
eases pain,

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.210
and relieves your headaches.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.690
How is Madam Yan?

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.010
I changed her medicine today.

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:22.620
But it seems

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:23.940
Madam Yan

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.500
is using her own secret remedies.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:29.420
Let her do as she wishes.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:35.980
Your Majesty, punish me.

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:38.690
For what offense?

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.620
I told Marquis of Nanyan about Madam Yan,

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.210
but failed to learn

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:44.810
what was planned at the banquet.

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:46.540
That put Your Majesty in danger.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.100
Your Majesty bore no grudge,

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.060
saved my parents, and even kept me in service.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.660
But I have been useless.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:02.770
I've told you many times:

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.210
your parents are my subjects.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.130
Saving them was no favor to you.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:11.370
He has not suspected you

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:12.540
of anything.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:15.060
That proves you've done well.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.450
Just keep hiding your identity.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:22.420
Thanks for Your Majesty's great kindness. I'll take my leave.

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.060
Your Majesty, this was presented by Madam Yan.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:47.730
It's a record

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.260
of Marquis of Nanyan pulling strings in Liyang.

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:52.570
Why would she have it?

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:55.660
By offering this to Your Majesty,

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.730
Madam Yan is showing her loyalty.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.690
Your Majesty, Minister Chen seeks audience.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:04.690
Let him in.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.020
Your Majesty.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:11.970
Grave news!

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:14.540
What is it?

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:16.850
The jailers say Wei Xianyu is missing,

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.180
vanished as if into thin air.

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:29.940
Declare to the world he has died in prison.

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:34.900
So...

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.810
that was Your Majesty's doing?

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.900
Yet the jailers swear since last night

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.330
there's been no disturbance.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.420
How did Your Majesty pull it off?

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.020
Sima Jiao, what are you doing?

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:12.450
You call his name in your dreams,

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:14.940
yet wouldn't let him stay the night.

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.330
It's thanks to you that Wei Xianyu confessed

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:23.140
about the Marquis.

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:26.490
That account book in Sima Jiao's hands

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.260
will surely aid him.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.420
Thank you both for saving me.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.090
You escaped this time,

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.180
but beware the Marquis' men.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.690
Beware of him?

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:54.690
What do you mean?

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.780
Aren't you sent by the Marquis?

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:00.810
Fool.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.570
He meant to kill you.

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:04.260
Without His Majesty and Madam Yan,

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:05.850
you'd already be a corpse.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:06.660
No way.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.690
My family are still with him.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:09.730
He must know

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:11.140
I could never betray him!

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.970
Only the dead keep silent.

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:19.420
Since he cast you aside,

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.780
why would he spare your family?

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:30.330
Marquis of Nanyan! I swear I'll make you pay in blood!

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.970
If you pledge to His Majesty,

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.380
he'll help you avenge them.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.540
Rest easy.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.210
I'll tell His Majesty

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:46.780
everything I know.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.300
Had you not warned me to save Wei Xianyu first,

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.610
he'd already be dead.

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:56.140
What brings you here?

00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:58.810
Have you found You Yan?

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.180
Yes.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.850
Nianjiu followed Beauty Tong's demonic energy.

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:05.090
Though he found no trace of You Yan,

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.490
he did discover before her downfall,

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:09.490
Beauty Tong had met with Marquis of Nanyan.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:10.970
The Marquis...

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:14.940
He ordered Wei Xianyu to assassinate Sima Jiao.

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:17.380
Was he colluding with You Yan?

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.330
Highly possible.

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:20.940
If the Marquis seizes the throne,

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:22.210
then Sima Jiao

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:24.380
will never achieve whatever he seeks

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:25.380
as emperor.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:26.900
Dream on!

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.690
And I uncovered something crucial.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.850
Hearing is false and seeing is true.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.260
Come with me.

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:51.900
But... Madam Yan was just resting here.

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:59.660
[Hushan Hall]
Jiang Cha, guard Ziquan Palace with them.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.810
Let no one know Madam Yan is absent.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:03.020
Yes.

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:07.420
Chi Anhe and I

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.140
searched every corner of the Pavilion of Destiny.

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.810
What the Hu Kingdom emperor

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.730
most fears You Yan coveting

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:14.850
is the worship ritual.

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:18.380
And this is the very site of that rite.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:26.940
A barrier woven of spiritual power in the mortal realm?

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:29.660
Clearly this rite

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:32.300
is a key part of Sima Jiao's plan here.

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:35.540
He must know something we don't,

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:38.780
and rushed to stop it.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.300
Then You Yan aiding the Marquis

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:45.690
must also be after this rite.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.330
We cannot let them succeed.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.570
Even the Spirit Fire can't break this barrier.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.090
There must be more to it.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.450
If I can enter,

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.210
I may learn Sima Jiao's true plan.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.180
If only Sima Jiao

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.940
can regain his memory now,

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.210
then all will be clear.

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:23.020
But he has lost his memory,

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.970
and we cannot break this barrier.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.660
[Hushan Hall]
Who knows what he and You Yan truly plot.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.900
Why make him remember?

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.850
Better he just stay an emperor.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.060
Yet whatever he and You Yan seek

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.810
is tied to that throne.

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:42.330
So I'll help him hold it steady.

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:45.140
As for You Yan, he's a master of hiding.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:46.780
But we can use

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:47.970
the Marquis as bait

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:48.970
to drag him out.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:50.450
Madam,

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:51.810
one thing puzzles me.

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:54.900
That demon lady just entered Sima Jiao's side.

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:56.300
Why is she

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.940
so blindly devoted to him?

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.490
You may not know this.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.850
Sima Jiao and Liao Tingyan

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:03.260
were demon lovers in a past life.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.970
This life, they're fated to tangle again.

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:09.780
If that's so,

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:12.570
why not make use of it

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:15.810
to our advantage?

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.330
You mean

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:25.490
to press Sima Jiao in court?

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:28.810
An official proposed

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.060
digging a canal

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.810
between the Lan River and the Chi River.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.330
But the cost was far too great,

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:38.900
so I shelved it.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.180
If we hang this

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:43.540
on Sima Jiao,

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:47.330
and brand him a foolish tyrant,

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:49.730
it will serve us well.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:54.730
But we'll need your help, Madam.

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:56.450
Speak freely.

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:01.450
I'll stir pressure in court,

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:06.690
forcing Sima Jiao to order the canal.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.780
While it's being dug,

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:11.380
you need only create a disaster.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.020
Excellent.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.780
The grudges of the people will fester,

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:19.490
topple his throne,

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:24.060
and swell Liao Tingyan's demon core,

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.900
so she'll finish him for us.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.660
Marquis of Nanyan is really a master of deceit.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.690
Just now in court,

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:43.060
he went on and on about building the canal.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:45.810
He put on such an earnest face

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:48.140
that I almost believed

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.330
he was a loyal minister serving the realm.

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:52.180
I suspect

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.810
he means to trap Your Majesty

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:54.940
in a dilemma.

00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:00.140
I grew up under his teaching.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.140
There isn't a single trick of his

00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:05.250
I don't know.

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:09.100
I'll wait and see

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:12.210
what new tricks he dares try.

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:14.340
Your Majesty stayed at Ziquan Palace all night,

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:16.250
then faced court affairs at dawn.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.660
Perhaps you should rest.

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:22.660
No, I'll stay at Ziquan Palace,

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:25.530
see when she returns.

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:28.660
You think I'm so easy to fool?

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.100
Nothing but lies.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.010
If I came here myself,

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.730
I knew Madam Yan was inside.

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:35.380
I dare not deceive.

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:36.820
The madam truly isn't in the palace.

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:37.490
You...

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.180
Stop.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:43.180
Your Majesty.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.690
Si Xian, such temper.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:48.860
This must be Marquis of Nanyan's daughter.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.100
Here to pick faults with me?

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:53.530
Your Majesty,

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:55.180
[Noble Consort Si Xian]
I only thought

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.140
Madam Yan is far from home

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.940
and having just endured such misfortune,

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.250
she must be unsettled.

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:01.730
So I came especially to visit her.

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:04.140
But this maid kept...

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.290
Still, no need to use force.

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:09.250
Yes.

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:24.380
Don't hurt yourself.

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.940
Weren't you to dine with me tonight?

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:36.620
Yesterday His Majesty refused me.

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:38.180
Why the sudden change today?

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:39.690
Go prepare now.

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:42.660
Understood.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.100
I'll return now to ready myself for Your Majesty's visit.

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.730
Let's go.

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:03.250
Greetings to Your Majesty.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.620
I especially prepared this tea for you.

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:15.340
It restores energy and calms the mind.

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:19.210
Having a headache again?

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:24.250
Yeah.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.050
Dealing with Noble Consort Si Xian's father in court by day,

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.580
and coaxing her in the harem by night,

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:32.860
how can you not have a headache?

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.140
And you weren't idle either.

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:40.420
I came to Ziquan Palace

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:43.140
and found you nowhere.

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:45.450
Where were you?

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.940
I didn't know Your Majesty would come so early.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.340
I shouldn't have gone to the Imperial Garden to practice.

00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:59.210
But I came last night.

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.580
I couldn't sleep,

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.620
so I wandered the Imperial Garden.

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:13.690
And I got lost.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.340
Madam, His Majesty searched for you

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.140
many times in the garden alone.

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:26.940
Well, I fell down a well. Do you believe me?

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.180
Deceiving the emperor is punishable by death.

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.380
Choose your answer carefully, Madam.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:45.900
I don't wish to lie to Your Majesty.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.900
May I simply not speak?

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.490
Have you thought of His Majesty?

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.180
He worried over you so much.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.210
He waited here all night.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.690
He feared you might never return,

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.900
feared Si Xian

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.250
would seize on your absence.

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:15.140
So he kept it quiet,

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:17.140
only sent men to search in secret.

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:19.140
Why won't you tell me?

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.820
If your head still aches,

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.050
let me massage it for you.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.530
No need.

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:51.450
I made Your Majesty wait all night.

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:53.100
That was my fault.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:55.380
But I want you to know,

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:59.100
all I've done is for you,

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.210
not for anyone else.

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:07.620
I never doubted your heart.

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:12.690
I only wish you can be more open.

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:21.420
Forget it.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:22.900
Do you know

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.140
why I wept the first time I saw you?

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:28.050
No.

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:30.340
I've waited for you nineteen years,

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.770
fearing I'd never see you again.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.690
I have so much to say,

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.450
so much to ask...

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.290
Where have you been all these years?

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:53.770
Sima Jiao?

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:56.050
Sima Jiao!

00:22:58.790 --> 00:22:59.820
Then why don't you ask?

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:02.140
Seeing Your Majesty

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.050
living well here now,

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:07.580
that's enough for me.

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.660
My headaches come from you.

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:17.730
You must answer for them.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.250
Physicians have tried for years

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:29.530
and found no cure.

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:33.010
Yet you can ease it.

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:34.490
Even now,

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:37.450
you test me still.

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.050
You always keep secrets from me,

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:41.900
and won't let me wonder.

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:43.950
So many worries,

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.490
no wonder you ache.

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.340
I am the emperor.

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.420
How dare you be so bold with me.

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:56.010
Even if you forbid it,

00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:58.900
I've been bold so many times.

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:03.530
And you rather like it,

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:05.970
don't you?

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.770
At last, you smile.

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:34.460
So your mood is lighter.

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:42.340
You wished only for my happiness,

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:45.690
yet I...

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:48.420
What is it?

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:54.100
I shouldn't have used Si Xian to provoke you.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.340
Even without her,

00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:59.730
there are concubines aplenty.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.100
Behind each woman in the harem

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:08.010
stands a faction with its schemes.

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:09.770
Though I must balance them,

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:13.340
I've never touched a single one.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:19.250
But...

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.450
you are different.

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:24.340
What makes me different?

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:26.580
You are the one

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:28.820
who wants nothing from me,

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:31.010
the one who visits me in dreams.

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:02.770
Time for dinner.

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:05.530
Won't you eat with Si Xian tonight?

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:07.490
No.

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.820
The Marquis forced me to build the canal.

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:15.730
Let Si Xian take that as my reply.

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:18.690
If the Marquis really colludes with You Yan,

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:21.490
then this canal is far from simple.

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:24.860
What's he scheming now?

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:26.530
About the canal,

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.340
if we build it, the people suffer.

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:33.900
If we don't, transport suffers.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.730
The Marquis' pressuring me,

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:37.900
hoping to trap me in a dilemma,

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.010
leaving me no way out.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.380
It does sound like

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.860
there's no winning move.

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:48.690
But Your Majesty looks calm,

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:51.860
so you must already have a plan.

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:54.970
I've ordered

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:59.450
the canal designed to suit the land,

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:02.340
cutting costs by thirty percent.

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.100
As for labor,

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:06.620
we'll pay fair wages to willing hands.

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:10.460
It may take longer to finish the canal,

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:13.970
but its benefits will last for ages.

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:16.850
The canal is truly a blessing for the nation.

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:19.930
Your Majesty should follow through,

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:23.090
perhaps even gain more than expected.

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:24.860
You are Heaven's chosen.

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:26.580
Heaven itself will aid you.

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:34.140
You demon lady's sweet talk

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:35.970
only clouds my mind.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:37.650
I told you,

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.010
I'm a fairy.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.380
Even if you want stars from the sky,

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.690
I'll pluck them down for you.

00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:57.650
I don't want stars.

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:01.100
I only want a clear and steady court.

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:02.690
That alone will satisfy me.

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:04.490
If possible,

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.820
I'd rather be an ordinary man,

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:11.050
enjoy life's simple pleasures,

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:13.380
carefree and free.

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:17.930
Here, my lord.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:19.140
Smells nice!

00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:30.060
Still,

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:32.300
I've known since birth

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:34.930
that I bear the weight of Hu Kingdom.

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.580
All I wish is to keep this land safe.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:42.010
Then let me see to your peace and comfort.

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:44.580
So you may have both:

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:46.620
the warmth of everyday life

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:48.650
and the throne.

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.410
Grand Preceptor, can't you see farther?

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:01.620
The canal will divert the Lan River,

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:04.170
stop the yearly floods,

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:07.440
open the north-south waterway,

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:09.210
and bring wealth to the counties along it.

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:12.860
It will bless future generations!

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:14.930
Future generations?

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.820
Shouldn't you look to the present?

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:20.970
Since the late emperor's passing, Yan Prefecture has suffered drought.

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:23.600
Countless go hungry,

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.190
families ruined,

00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:28.040
even children eaten by parents!

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:30.410
And now you want a canal?

00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:32.300
Such a massive work,

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:36.100
how many laborers will be dragged into it?

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:37.970
And so what?

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:39.860
Some sacrifice

00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:41.540
for glory lasting millennia.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:42.740
Which weighs more?

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:45.100
My lord, you are wrong!

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:47.060
The people are the foundation.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.730
Strong foundation makes a stable state.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.450
Drain the people

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.840
will enrage Heaven and man!

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.640
When the people rebel,

00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:59.010
what legacy remains?

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:00.780
Enough, Grand Preceptor.

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.340
You've grown too old,

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.980
confusing right and wrong.

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:08.380
Better retire to your hometown.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:08.820
Hey!

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:10.380
Your Majesty,

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:13.170
the canal has been debated for days.

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:15.100
Please, give a ruling.

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:17.170
Your words show

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:21.620
such devotion to the people,

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:23.140
such tireless concern.

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.450
Sharing Your Majesty's burdens,

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:27.970
toiling for the people,

00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:29.690
that is my duty.

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:31.250
For this,

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.690
I will give my all,

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.380
serve until death.

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:38.140
Uncle, your diligence

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:41.060
puts me to shame.

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:43.450
Why not

00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:46.450
just take my throne yourself?

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.690
Your Majesty is now the ruler of a nation.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:00.540
How can you still joke like this?

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.780
Without the worship ritual,

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:06.650
how can I call myself emperor?

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.410
Please, mind your words.

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:17.540
No need to take it so seriously, Uncle.

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:20.650
All right.

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:23.100
Since the Marquis insists,

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:25.140
then let it be built.

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:34.650
See Your Majesty off.

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:47.140
Send Chi Anhe and two demon generals

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:48.580
to help Sima Jiao with the canal.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.620
You'll use the power of the Immortal-Demon Ruler

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.780
to aid a mere mortal emperor?

00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.820
He's not just any emperor.

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:01.490
He's my sweetie.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:03.860
Fine.

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.450
But seriously,

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:08.450
what is your true aim?

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:10.620
Sima Jiao told me

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:13.250
Marquis of Nanyan is pushing hard on the canal.

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:15.340
It must be a scheme

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:16.540
he and You Yan have plotted.

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:18.210
Then let's play along,

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:19.540
see what they're plotting.

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:21.970
Might even draw You Yan out.

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:34.970
Avoid farmland and villages.

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:36.380
That was Her Majesty's order.

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:37.380
Understood.

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.860
What... what's happening?

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.100
This flash flood is strange.

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:02.650
Why would it cross high ground to hit the village?

00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:10.930
It must be You Yan's doing.

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:12.010
Tingyan warned us

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:13.620
the villagers' safety comes first.

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:14.860
I'll go after him.

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:16.730
You guys stay here and guard the people.

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:17.730
Yes, sir.

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:32.410
This useless body...

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.210
He caught up so fast!

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:46.210
Oh no, he got away.

00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:58.060
Nianjiu,

00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.540
did you find You Yan?

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:00.580
He escaped.

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:02.210
Tingyan was right.

00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:03.450
The canal project

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.170
is no doubt a trap set by You Yan.

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:06.730
No wonder.

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.820
Anhe and I were working.

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:09.700
Everything went smoothly.

00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:11.700
But just as we neared completion,

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:13.050
the dike was destroyed,

00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:14.090
and the flood burst out.

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.090
We nearly lost it all.

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:38.700
Madam...

00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:46.130
Liangchen.

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:47.220
I'm sorry.

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:49.090
Are you hurt?

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:50.660
I'm fine.

00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:53.410
Madam, were you having a nightmare?

00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:56.610
It seems...

00:34:57.590 --> 00:34:59.900
the demonic energy You Yan left in me

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.090
has begun to stir.

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:02.970
Your Majesty,

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.450
urgent reports have arrived from every province.

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.380
The canal was finished overnight!

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:09.260
Overnight?

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:09.970
Yes.

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:11.820
Villagers saw divine figures

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.700
guiding the flood into the channel.

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:15.860
And at once the canal was formed.

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:18.380
The officials' reports

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:19.970
even included drawings of it.

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.010
Now the people believe

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.490
it's due to Your Majesty's blessing,

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:35.090
a great fortune for all.

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:38.490
I told you,

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:40.820
I'm a fairy.

00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:42.820
Even if you want stars from the sky,

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:45.090
I'll pluck them down for you.

00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:47.970
She really did pluck a star for me.

00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:09.860
At least hide yourselves better next time.

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:14.570
Got it.

00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.610
Grandmaster...

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:20.010
He's not dead.

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:25.130
Really, you guys.

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.010
Why barge into the palace?

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:30.220
I finally got Sima Jiao to trust me,

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.740
and now he'll start doubting again.

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:35.530
Your Majesty,

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:38.220
when we were working on the canal,

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:38.930
a sudden flood struck.

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:42.340
It was indeed You Yan's doing.

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:44.860
He possessed Bi'an's body.

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:46.410
But...

00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:49.130
but I failed to catch him.

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:52.050
He escaped again.

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:54.490
We'll need another way to trap him.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:55.780
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:58.700
Once Grandmaster regains his memory,

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:01.180
perhaps we'll know his plan.

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.010
It's too late.

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.300
Sima Jiao hides things from us all.

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:07.490
This must be deadly serious.

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:10.740
I must learn his plan soon.

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.180
Next time,

00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:15.530
send word to me first.

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:17.050
Don't barge into my chambers.

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:20.300
I... I just missed Grandmaster.

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:21.820
And you didn't miss me?

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:22.610
Of course I did!

00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:24.860
If I didn't,

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.490
why would I bring you your favorite

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:29.610
Spirit Dew?

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:31.820
Thoughtful of you!

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:07.490
Earlier...

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:10.260
was someone else here?

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:11.780
No, no one.

00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:13.490
You must've dreamed it.

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:42.930
Sima Jiao!

00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.570
Is it because

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:16.340
of that past-life bond she spoke of,

00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:18.970
that I feel so at peace beside her?

00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:24.410
But maybe,

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:27.660
at her side,

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:32.180
there are things I don't know.

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:36.260
You must've all heard

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:39.490
the tale of the canal forming overnight.

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:41.820
Marquis,

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:44.260
what say you?

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:50.260
Surely it was Your Majesty's blessing.

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:51.930
A fortune for the people.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:53.570
And the rest of you?

00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:59.530
It must be Your Majesty's blessing, a fortune for the people!

00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:01.130
Good.

00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:03.780
Then we are agreed.

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:06.450
But speaking of blessings,

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:09.050
since Madam Yan came to me,

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:11.610
everything has gone my way.

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:13.450
Even this canal's success

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:15.860
seems owed to her.

00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:17.340
Indeed.

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:19.220
All thanks to Madam Yan.

00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:22.340
Your Majesty's Heaven's chosen, blessed without limit.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:26.090
How can the credit go to her?

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.180
Why not?

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:33.090
Or do you, Grand Minister of Works,

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:35.340
have another explanation?

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:36.900
I...

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.180
What say you, ministers?

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:53.300
If so...

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:54.530
Your Majesty!

00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:57.220
It proves

00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:59.780
Your Majesty's Heaven's chosen,

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:03.130
and Madam Yan a goddess descended!

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:06.780
Madam Yan's a goddess descended!

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:10.780
Your Majesty's Heaven's chosen!

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:15.410
You promised me it.

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:18.050
Why have you failed it?

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:20.260
Are you upset about the canal?

00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:22.780
It's more than that!

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:27.450
My daughter is suffering.

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.700
Now everyone out there

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:33.740
calls that demon lady a goddess.

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:35.340
I don't even know

00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:39.180
are you helping me,

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.340
or helping Sima Jiao?

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.410
Of course I stand with you.

00:42:45.550 --> 00:42:48.010
Though the canal didn't cause disaster as we wished,

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:51.010
the rest proceeds as planned.

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.660
I'll feed on the grudges of the people

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:55.260
to swell Liao Tingyan's demon core,

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:57.410
bend her mind,

00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:59.490
and have her kill Sima Jiao for us.

00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:01.900
If she resists,

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:04.410
she'll have to burn away all her power.

00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:07.820
Either way, we'll see him dead.

00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:09.860
Your plan is so thorough.

00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:12.380
Why come to me again?

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:21.410
I need you to gather

00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:22.860
a hundred boys and girls.

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:29.180
You might as well

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:31.130
hand my head to Sima Jiao yourself.

00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:36.130
Don't be hasty, Marquis.

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:39.860
I'll conjure a great drought,

00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:43.380
and use those children for the rite.

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:46.530
Drought and their deaths

00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:49.410
will throw the people into chaos.

00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:54.410
I never thought

00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:55.780
you'd be more ruthless

00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:58.130
than that demon lady.

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:02.700
Great deeds

00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:04.090
need sacrifice.

00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:07.340
We'll use that disaster's resentment

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:09.220
to feed her demon core.

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:10.700
Then...

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:11.560
Then,

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:13.680
I'll back your petition

00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:17.490
to brand Liao Tingyan a demon, right?

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:18.740
Exactly.

00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:24.570
I'll face the court openly,

00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:27.300
but if anything goes wrong,

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:29.490
I'll take the blame

00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:33.900
for killing children and spreading lies!

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:40.180
Don't you trust me anymore, Marquis?

00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:43.490
Before the canal,

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.410
I did trust you.

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:47.380
But now,

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:49.090
I'm not so sure.

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:55.090
We'll discuss it later.

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:06.260
You're just a mortal, after all.

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:08.450
Fine.

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:11.970
If you don't follow my plan,

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:16.130
I'll make the choice for you!

00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:26.780
What's this?

00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:28.770
Look! Dead birds everywhere.

00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:29.780
Why are they falling?

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:30.410
What's happening?

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:31.450
They're dead!

00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:32.130
How...?

00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:53.050
I'm not hurt.

00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:56.410
Then whose blood is this?

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:01.410
The demonic energy in me has driven me to kill?
