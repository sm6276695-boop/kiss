(Take his life.)

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.480
I'll let you leave with the child.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.440
A glistening blade.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.280
Jade-white salt.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.520
Slender hands peel a fresh orange.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.200
All taught by my master.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.280
In my presence,

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.920
you needn't pretend to be Ye Xiyan.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.920
I no longer know if I'm Ye Xiyan

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.880
or Shen Yuqing.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.000
This was left by my mother.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.640
She told me to give it

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.960
to my beloved.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.000
I once thought

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.240
I'd never get to give it away.

you've walked alone in the darkness.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.040
My initial purpose

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.000
was simply to protect those around me.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.760
But...

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.040
You never knew any of this.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.560

nothing but pain,

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.680
doubt, and hurt.

This time,

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.960
let me be the one to shield you.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:30.920
Give me this chance.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.600
I'll protect you and the child.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.320
What are you doing?

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.400
Just stand behind me.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.120

Don't touch me!

I didn't harm your family.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.960
It wasn't my fault.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.400
I'm sorry.

Jin, listen to me.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.608
Jin.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.840
No matter how you change,

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.680
I'll never mind.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.280
You remain my Changyi,

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.280

(Ye Xiyan: Pei Ji plans
to kill Pei Zhao in your chambers)

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.000
(and frame you.)

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:18.976
(Upon hearing the news,)

00:08:18.976 --> 00:08:22.040
(he'll stage a coup
to seize the throne.)

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.800
(To appease me,)

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.720
(he'll name me Princess Consort,)

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.520
(promising the future position
of Empress.)

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.240
(Pei Ji defies all moral principles.)

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.280
(I don't want to ally with him.)

00:08:38.272 --> 00:08:41.040
No kinship matters before the throne.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.720
How ruthlessly ambitious
the Prince Regent is.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.640
Have Shen Yuanjin take Pei Zhao
out of the palace immediately.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.640
Summon Ye Xiyan discreetly.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.120
If she wants to protect the child,

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.960
ensure Pei Ji attends

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.680
the morning court session
as usual today.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.360
Understood.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.080
Before Zhao is safely evacuated,

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.840
the Empress Dowager will try

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.280
to keep you in the palace.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.720
After Zhao is safely evacuated,

00:09:21.216 --> 00:09:22.080
she'll eliminate...

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:22.920
Eliminate me.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.320
If Zhao can't be evacuated,

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.560
she will risk her life

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.440
to clash with me at Xuanzheng Hall.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.520
I control the imperial guards.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.360
If anyone dies, it'll be her.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:44.992
Therefore,

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.960
her schemes won't reach that far.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.160
Having survived her torments

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.240
to this day

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.680
and becoming Prince Regent,

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.320
I understand her better than you.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.880
She's just like Madam Su,

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.000
vicious but short-sighted.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.840
Don't overthink it.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.600
Just focus on saving Zhao.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.320
That you care for me

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:08.840
is enough.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.520
Your Highness.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.200
Shen Yuanjin has left the palace

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.120
with Master Zhao.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.360
I've got people on them.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.360
We must act swiftly.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.560
Zhao still awaits you.

00:10:22.944 --> 00:10:23.880
Go now.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.520
If the Empress Dowager
realizes the trick,

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.720
it won't end well for you.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.760
If I don't attend court,

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:28.960
she'll be suspicious,

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.960
and Zhao'll be in danger.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.080
The situation I'm facing

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.560
is but a fraction of the battlefield.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.160
After we succeed,

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.400
you shall hide in the villa.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.920
Wait until I bring you home.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.288
Pei Ji,

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.520
Zhao and I

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.520
will wait for you at the villa.
