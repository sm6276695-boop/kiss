[When Destiny Brings The Demon]

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.500
[Based on the JJWXC novel "When Destiny Brings The Demon" by Fu Hua]

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.380
[Episode 32]
[What I Gave You Is Yours to Do With as You Will]

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.370
The demonic energy in me has driven me to kill?

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.940
Madam,

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.620
may I come in to help you with your hair?

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.860
Wait outside for now.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.940
Yes.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:50.370
Liangchen,

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.220
have you heard anything about what happened in the palace?

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.950
I just heard

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.140
that all the birds in the harem died overnight.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.370
Could it have been my doing?

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.810
Is my demon core

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:06.940
acting up again?

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.620
I have to see Master.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.810
Father?

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.340
I heard you went to see Madam Yan?

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.530
I sent you letter after letter warning you

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.940
to stay away from her.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.220
Why didn't you listen?

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.620
But you once told me

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.690
to win His Majesty's favor to keep him under control.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.020
I just wanted to put Madam Yan

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.940
in her place

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.250
so she'd stop competing with me.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.900
That was then. Things are different now.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.500
This is not the time to fight for favor.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.180
Just do as I say.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.460
I only want to keep you safe.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.690
This is an artifact I obtained from an immortal.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.690
Keep it with you.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.130
It will protect you.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.370
Your Majesty, the demonic energy in your demon core

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.340
is indeed beginning to stir.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.060
Those birds died

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.620
because of it.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.780
Fortunately,

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.090
I have devised a prescription

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.130
that can temporarily suppress the energy.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.530
What if it grows so strong

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.220
we can no longer control it?

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.130
What then?

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.940
You would need to give up all your cultivation.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.650
Only then

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.810
would the demon core in your body become inert,

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.460
unable to control you.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.220
But your cultivation

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:51.810
would vanish as well.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.410
If I lose all my cultivation, I won't be able to protect Sima Jiao.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.020
But if I fall under the demon core's control

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.690
and become You Yan's pawn,

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.460
I will kill Sima Jiao with my own hands.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.180
That is You Yan's scheme.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.570
Is there truly no other way

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.220
out of this trap?

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.570
The Spirit Fire and the demon core restrain each other,

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.500
but the demon core can break free one day

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.130
and completely suppress the Spirit Fire.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.450
If you do not want to lose your cultivation,

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.660
you must instead strengthen the Spirit Fire within you.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.540
How?

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.980
By burning it with your own blood as fuel.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.370
But that would be like using poison as medicine.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.250
And if you wish to suppress the demon core entirely,

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.250
I fear...

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.250
I fear it would take your very bones and blood as a sacrifice.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.660
Your life itself would burn away.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.420
Jiao told me

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.500
that you were a goddess descending to earth,

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.980
fated with him from a past life.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.450
He also said that the canal

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.130
couldn't have been built without your help.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.300
I couldn't help but wonder: could Jiao and I

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.010
also share a bond from a former life?

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.660
In your past lives, Your Majesty and His Majesty were also mother and son.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.010
I believe his rebirth in this world

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:34.570
was to follow you here

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:36.860
so that he could be with you again.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.660
Really?

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.860
What a sweet girl you are.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.690
Seeing how fond Jiao is of you,

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.980
I am sure he will make you Empress once he completes

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.620
his coming-of-age ceremony.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.370
After that,

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.450
you will both take part in the worship ritual,

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.130
and I can finally

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.540
put my worries to rest.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.330
Your Majesty,

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:02.740
do you mean

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.540
that the empress may also enter the Hushan Hall for the rite?

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:06.500
Of course.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.370
The Emperor and Empress must go together into Hushan Hall to perform the ritual.

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:12.500
It has been the tradition of the Hu Kingdom

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.740
for generations.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.180
After the ritual,

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.060
Jiao will formally inherit

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.010
the jade seal kept in the hall

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.370
and truly become the emperor of Hu.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.910
[Ziquan Palace]

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:31.540
Your Majesty,

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.370
must the worship ritual wait

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:34.770
until after the wedding?

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:36.810
The ritual can only happen

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:38.500
after the coming-of-age ceremony

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.060
and then the wedding.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.060
This has always been the tradition of the Hu Kingdom.

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:45.690
Why do you suddenly ask?

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:47.890
Your Majesty, I helped you accomplish

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:49.980
something as great as the canal.

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.060
By merit alone, shouldn't I already be named Empress?

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.740
Could you name me Empress right after your coming-of-age ceremony?

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.300
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:02.420
It will be you sooner or later.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:04.420
Why are you in such a hurry?

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.940
I...

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.570
What's wrong?

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:20.420
You're burning up.

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:22.210
No need to worry, Your Majesty.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:23.940
I only need a little rest.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.740
I once dreamed

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:31.330
of fire

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:34.690
raging in my body.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.620
It looked exactly like you now.

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:43.690
Back then, I couldn't truly understand your pain.

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.070
It was only after I carried

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:49.620
the Spirit Fire refined from your soul

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:51.180
that I finally understood

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.060
how deep your suffering had been.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.210
How did I

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.890
ease the pain at that time?

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:11.810
I would do this.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.250
And once,

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.300
I even brought snowfall for Your Majesty.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.180
Speaking of which, it's been so long since I last saw snow.

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:38.940
When it snows again,

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.380
I will be there with you.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:42.540
Great.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.450
When it is only

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:48.570
the two of us,

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.300
may I stop calling you

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:53.260
"Your Majesty"?

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:55.140
I think

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:55.690
that "you,"

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:56.490
"me,"

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:57.330
and "us"

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.380
sound much more beautiful.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:03.660
I agree.
[*speaking formally]

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.090
I agree.
[*speaking plainly]

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:16.850
Does it still hurt?

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.140
You kissed me first.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.090
And I'm done kissing you.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.060
You don't decide when it ends.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.540
Don't be difficult.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:52.970
Time for bed.

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:07.330
Are you upset?

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:13.660
No.

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:17.940
Isn't it nice to just chat under the quilt

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:20.140
like this?

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:22.540
If you touch me again,

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:24.780
I can't promise

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.020
it will only be talking under the quilt.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.020
That's fine.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.810
I will make sure it is.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:42.900
You're cheating.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.900
Why won't you let me get close to you?

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.610
I have my reason.

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:06.020
Then why can't you tell me the reason?

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.020
It isn't time yet.

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.100
Then when will it be time?

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:13.890
Tell me,

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.370
do you know what a Soul Manor is?

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:20.100
I don't.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.820
Then just sleep under the quilt.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.740
After the worship ritual,

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:27.010
you'll know.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.940
"Meet me at the lakeside at the Chou hour.

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:55.330
Nianjiu."

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.730
Nianjiu would never send me a note.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.330
This is obviously fake.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.730
At least learn from real scammers before trying this.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.020
Next time, send me a message first.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.610
Don't just barge into my chamber.

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:13.810
I once told Nianjiu to send me a message first

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:15.140
if he found You Yan's trace.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.660
Did he really find it?

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.490
That demon, Liao Tingyan,

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:05.180
has bewitched His Majesty,

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.210
and now she's even used sorcery to deceive the world!

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.260
What... what's that?

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:27.300
"Come to the Ziquan Palace lakeside alone at the Chou hour,

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.750
[Come to the Ziquan Palace lakeside]

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:30.420
or your entire clan will be killed."

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:35.940
This is outrageous.

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:37.540
Go.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.090
Fetch my cloak and Demon-Revealing Mirror.

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:43.180
Madam, you mustn't go.

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:44.660
With the mirror, what do I have to fear?

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:47.140
I will make His Majesty and the Empress Dowager

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:49.260
see that demon's true colors!

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:50.570
Listen,

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.090
if I haven't returned within two hours,

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.060
take people to look for me.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:55.850
Do you understand?

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:57.140
Yes.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.210
How did I fall asleep?

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:21.610
Where is Nianjiu?

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:28.660
There she is!

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.090
Blood...

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:38.570
So much blood!

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:52.570
Your Majesty.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:53.900
Your Majesty,

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.150
we found Noble Consort Si Xian's body

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:57.900
in Madam Yan's palace.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.970
Her blood was completely drained,

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.020
and her flesh looked as though it had been eaten clean by a beast.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:04.690
Can you determine the time of death?

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.330
Roughly during the Chou hour.

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:08.330
That matches the testimony

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:09.690
from her maid and guards.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:10.780
Your Majesty,

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.020
all signs point

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:16.570
to Madam Yan...

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:17.330
Chen Tang,

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.380
you compared the handwriting on these two notes yourself.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.380
Can't you see this is a deliberate frame-up?

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:24.450
Your Majesty,

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:27.060
if this is a frame-up,

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:29.850
why was there blood

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:33.260
on Madam Yan's clothing?

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.850
That is what you should be investigating.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:38.940
Your Majesty,

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:40.420
to uncover the truth quickly,

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.610
I beg Your Majesty

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:47.020
to order Madam Yan held in detention pending trial.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.020
Chen Tang,

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.970
have you grown tired of being Minister of Justice?

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.380
As long as I serve in this position,

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:02.660
I will carry out my duty to the fullest.

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:05.850
Your Majesty,

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:10.780
in order to clear my name,

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.060
please grant Minister Chen's request

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:14.970
and allow me to be held in custody.

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:17.060
No.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:19.570
I will not let you be thrown in prison.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.140
My mind is made up.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.140
Minister Chen, please lead the way.

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.450
This cell is cleaner than I expected.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.300
Is this really the time

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:44.090
to care about that?

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.540
Hongluo.

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:46.660
Nianjiu.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:47.330
Tingyan,

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:48.730
why did you ask to be imprisoned

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.450
over Noble Consort Si Xian's death?

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.570
All the evidence

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:54.940
points to me now.

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:57.060
If I let Sima Jiao defend me,

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.380
it will stir resentment among the ministers

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.380
and give the Marquis of Nanyan an opening.

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.610
By choosing imprisonment myself,

00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:05.900
I at least lessen suspicion.

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:07.380
Besides,

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.970
I fear You Yan may try something

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.970
to make my demon core lose control.

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.530
It's safer for Sima Jiao if I stay away.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:20.860
That must be Sima Jiao.

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:21.770
You two should go.

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:46.180
You came just like this?

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.730
No guards at all?

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:51.250
What if I really were an evil demon?

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:56.140
If you truly were a monster who kills and drinks blood,

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:57.860
why would you target others?

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.380
Wouldn't the Heaven's chosen sleeping beside you

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:03.730
be far more delicious?

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:09.050
Come.

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:10.180
Let's go back together.

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:13.050
I will not let you stay in this filthy place.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:13.820
No.

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:17.250
If I leave,

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.420
the ministers will protest.

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:36.580
Noble Consort Si Xian's death could never have been Madam Yan's doing.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.410
For all your learning,

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.370
you still cannot read people,

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:42.340
and you imprisoned her?

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:43.540
Your Majesty,

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:44.540
it was...

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:47.210
it was Madam Yan who asked to be imprisoned.

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.410
Nevertheless, this has indeed

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.340
helped prove her innocence.

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.370
The schemers

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.450
will not set aside their hatred

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:58.300
just because of that.

00:18:58.880 --> 00:18:59.410
Do you understand?

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:03.500
Yi Huo,

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:07.340
visit the Marquis of Nanyan's manor more often these days.

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:08.650
I fear

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:10.970
he will put all the blame for Noble Consort Si Xian's death

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:13.060
on Madam Yan

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:14.740
and try something rash.

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:17.020
I will. Don't worry, Your Majesty.

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:20.170
Chen Tang,

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.410
keep investigating Noble Consort Si Xian's death.

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:25.410
Yes.

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:27.130
Also,

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.050
see to it that the prison food is well prepared,

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:36.180
and that her bedding is clean and comfortable.

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:40.900
Understood.

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:52.620
- Let go of me! - Let go!

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.100
Let...

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:55.140
Quiet!

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:57.100
Let go of me!

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.620
Noble Consort Si Xian has only just died,

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:13.450
yet you have already gathered so many boys and girls.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:14.820
Thank you for your efforts.

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:19.530
I never thought my daughter

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.580
would die at the hands of that demon, Liao Tingyan.

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:26.730
If only I had acted sooner.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.580
Now, she has died with hatred in her heart.

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:35.860
I must eliminate that demon, Liao Tingyan,

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:37.690
and avenge my daughter.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:43.050
I will bring you as many children as you need.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.620
Rest assured, my lord.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.490
Just wait and see.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.530
The Hu Kingdom is about to fall into great chaos.

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:51.250
When that time comes,

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.860
you will be the sovereign who restores order.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.940
Then I shall make Sima Jiao and that demon lady pay with their lives

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:01.290
for my daughter's death.

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:05.050
I await your good news, Madam.

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:34.210
Liao Tingyan,

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:37.820
this is the great gift I've prepared for you and Sima Jiao!

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:47.620
[Dushan County, Hu Kingdom]

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:37.860
I took the medicine Master gave me,

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.940
and the demonic energy was suppressed.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.010
Why did it suddenly lose control?

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.290
Mother!

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:30.660
This sudden drought and famine

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.180
must be You Yan's doing.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.940
He did it to strengthen my demon core through resentment,

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:40.900
and to undermine Sima Jiao's throne.

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:43.820
The Spirit Fire and the demon core restrain each other,

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.290
but the demon core can break free one day

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.690
and completely suppress the Spirit Fire.

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:51.250
If you do not want to lose your cultivation,

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.530
you must instead strengthen the Spirit Fire within you

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:58.380
by burning it with your own blood as fuel.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.530
But that would be like using poison as medicine.

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:04.450
If you wish to suppress the demon core entirely,

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.100
I fear it would take your very bones and blood as a sacrifice.

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:11.820
Your life itself would burn away.

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:45.730
Your Majesty,

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.820
a severe drought has struck Dushan County.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.530
Many people have starved to death.

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:52.290
In several towns, bodies of boys and girls

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:54.730
were found in rice fields, gnawed upon.

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:58.940
It seems the starving people have begun

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.820
to exchange children for food.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.010
Exchange children for food?

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.580
What a convenient excuse, General.

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:07.970
Your Majesty,

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.140
I have investigated.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.010
Those boys and girls

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:12.860
had already gone missing before the drought.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.770
They appeared in the fields out of nowhere,

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:17.820
and their manner of death is exactly the same as that of Noble Consort Si Xian.

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:21.140
This must be the work of a demon.

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.860
Your Majesty,

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.580
I have been observing the heavens these days.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.660
A demonic star has appeared above the palaces.

00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:32.140
This drought stemmed from that star.

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:35.290
If left unchecked, it could bring the downfall of the kingdom.

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.660
I implore Your Majesty

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:40.860
to burn the demon lady, Liao Tingyan,

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.770
and rid the people of this disaster.

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:05.490
The imperial palace

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.860
is not inhabited by Madam Yan alone.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:17.490
How do you know that this demonic star does not represent me?

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:22.860
Your Majesty, your coming-of-age ceremony is imminent.

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:26.290
How can you still speak such nonsense?

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:28.210
Doesn't my foolishness

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.380
all the better highlight your wisdom?

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:32.490
Your Majesty,

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:34.770
have you grown so blinded by that demon lady

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.690
that you can't even accept well-meaning advice?

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.340
As I recall, just a while ago,

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:57.450
all of you praised Madam Yan as a goddess descending to earth

00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:59.490
and a blessing to all.

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:03.050
Now you revile her as a demon,

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.340
condemning her as a curse to the nation.

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:08.930
You take salaries

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.060
and occupy high positions,

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.740
yet place the rise and fall of the Hu Kingdom

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:16.020
on the shoulders of one woman.

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:23.540
And you still dare tell me that you are

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.370
giving well-meaning advice?

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:32.450
General of the Household.

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:33.820
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:35.780
Open the granaries in Dushan County and distribute grain.

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.130
Strengthen the defenses of the borders

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:40.340
to prevent bandits from causing trouble.

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:41.970
Understood.

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:43.020
Chen Tang.

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:44.340
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:47.370
Investigate the deaths of the boys and girls as well.

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:49.260
Understood.

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:53.410
Marquis of Nanyan.

00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.020
You have just lost your daughter.

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:01.780
You should rest more.

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.820
For the next few days, you need not attend court.

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.930
Thank you for your concern, Your Majesty.

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:24.620
You are so weak as a Soulshift cultivator.

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:27.290
One block and you failed it.

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:30.690
Grandmaster, do you want to have some?

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.210
Too sweet.

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:34.450
Stop pretending. I can tell you want them.

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:36.770
If you crave them, I'll let you have your fill.

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:41.770
Zou Yan, stop slacking off.

00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:52.290
Why did I dream such strange things?

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:05.380
It worked.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.180
The Spirit Fire has suppressed the demon core in me.

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:13.380
What was so urgent you had to summon me?

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:14.730
Sit.

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:19.620
I want you to help Sima Jiao.

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:21.900
Take some demonic cultivators

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:23.940
and help ease the drought and famine in the mortal world.

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.860
Those mortals all think you are an evil demon,

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:29.420
and you still want to help them?

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:33.100
They have only been blinded by You Yan.

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:34.970
The common people are innocent.

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:36.730
Besides,

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:37.900
if rain falls from the heavens,

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:40.180
it will silence the rumors that I am an evil demon.

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:41.420
Fine.

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.100
You are the Immortal-Demon Ruler.

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.050
I will do as you say.

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.340
But why do you look so pale?

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:51.450
Are you saying my skin

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:52.970
has become smoother and softer?

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:55.970
One more thing.

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:58.250
The deaths of those innocent boys and girls

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.050
must be connected to You Yan.

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:02.100
If you trace the aura

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:03.490
left on them,

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:04.940
you may find his whereabouts.

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:09.250
I will leave this to you and Nianjiu.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:11.250
Got it.

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:12.380
Don't worry.

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:21.010
If it doesn't rain soon, not only the crops

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:23.210
but also the people will die.

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:24.860
Right.

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.730
His Majesty has been bewitched by that demon lady,

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.140
and in the end, it is we commoners who suffer.

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:45.490
This overwhelming resentment really is You Yan's doing.

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:13.690
It's raining!

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.770
- It's raining! - It's raining!

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:17.050
It's raining!

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:18.620
Heaven has sent sweet rain!

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:19.530
Wonderful!

00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:20.660
It's raining!

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:21.770
Heaven has sent sweet rain!

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:23.210
Finally it's raining!

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:25.530
- It's raining! - We're saved!

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:27.140
- It's raining! - Thank goodness!

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:30.660
- It's raining! - It's raining!

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:36.250
Finally it's raining!

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:38.100
Finally it's raining!

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:46.210
Your Majesty,

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:48.500
today's heavy rain has eased the drought.

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:50.300
Also, as you decreed,

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.340
relief funds have been distributed to the affected regions.

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:54.090
And thanks to the completed canal,

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:55.780
relief grain and supplies

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:57.100
reached the drought areas quickly.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:58.100
Good.

00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:00.700
Make sure inspections and audits are strict.

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.340
If there are any false disaster reports

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:03.940
or officials exploiting the people,

00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:04.970
punish them severely.

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:05.650
Understood.

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:07.210
And what did you find out

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:08.610
about the dead children?

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:10.450
Your Majesty,

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.780
I found that they were all

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:14.740
abducted

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:16.020
or kidnapped.

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:17.860
I have already arrested the trafficker,

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:19.300
but he insists

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:22.610
that he delivered them all to...

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:28.650
Madam Yan.

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:29.930
Absurd.

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.060
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:36.540
Clearly, whoever is behind this

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:38.860
is targeting Madam Yan.

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:43.650
This won't be the last attempt.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.450
Search the kingdom from top to bottom

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:47.820
and find whoever is responsible.

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.650
Yes.

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:49.860
Your Majesty,

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:52.450
I heard from the Marquis of Nanyan's servants

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.340
that they sometimes hear

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:55.450
children crying at night.

00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:58.130
Could this have something to do with him?

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:02.340
I understand that the Marquis of Nanyan might want to frame Madam Yan,

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:06.130
but would he really have gone so far as to kill Noble Consort Si Xian?

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:08.370
Chen Tang,

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.580
keep following that lead with the Marquis of Nanyan.

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:14.020
There may be things we don't yet know.

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:16.170
Yes.

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:22.890
Tomorrow is the coming-of-age ceremony.

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:24.970
Has Madam Yan

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:27.130
been told of this?

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:28.860
What did she say?

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:34.860
Madam Yan said that since she was under suspicion,

00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:38.130
she would rather remain in prison.

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:02.340
First capping.

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:05.060
On this auspicious day,

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.170
you don the headpiece of adulthood.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.410
Leave behind childish pursuits

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:11.570
and embrace virtue.

00:34:11.910 --> 00:34:13.410
May you live long and prosper,

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:15.970
and may great blessings be yours.

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:23.490
Second capping.

00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:26.930
In this favorable month and hour,

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:29.010
the headpiece is renewed.

00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:31.410
Uphold your dignity

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.260
and guard your virtue with prudence.

00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:35.450
May your years be countless

00:34:35.950 --> 00:34:37.490
and your blessings enduring.

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:39.300
Third capping.

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:40.530
In the rightful year

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:41.820
and in the blessed month,

00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:43.490
you don the third headpiece of adulthood.

00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:44.780
With your brothers beside you,

00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:46.180
your virtue is fulfilled.

00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:47.970
May your life be endless,

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:49.410
and may heaven bestow its grace upon you.

00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:58.180
This is the royal crown passed down from emperor to emperor in Hu.

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.050
Once His Majesty dons it,

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.620
he may worship the gods,

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:05.930
taking upon himself the well-being of all his people.

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:13.010
When I get out,

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:15.300
I'll kill you all!

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.220
If you are in such pain,

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:24.220
why don't you just kill me?

00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:25.970
I have no reason to.

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:27.370
There's no grudge between us.

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:28.660
I told you,

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:30.970
if I don't want you to die,

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:32.890
you won't die.

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:34.820
Boss...

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:38.450
Don't waste such a handsome face looking so gloomy.

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:40.220
Tingyan!

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:45.010
Tingyan!

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:46.490
Tingyan!

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.220
Your soul must still be here.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.450
I will find it.

00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:51.740
You can treat today

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:53.700
as our first encounter.

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:55.820
From now on,

00:35:56.910 --> 00:35:58.370
I will create new memories for us,

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:00.220
memories that belong

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:02.570
only to the present.

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:04.740
Why did you give me all your cultivation?

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:06.490
What I leave you

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:08.620
are the people and things you love.

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:10.780
Wherever you are,

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:13.860
I will always find my way back to you.

00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:29.970
Long live the Emperor!

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:53.850
Show yourself.

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:01.340
You dare ignore my words now,

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:03.570
you foolish snake?

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:07.780
Grandmaster, you've remembered everything?

00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:11.140
Have your powers returned as well?

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:13.410
I'm still only mortal flesh and blood,

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:15.340
capable of a little magic.

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:19.780
That's why I need you

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:21.780
to do something for me.

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:24.340
At your command, Grandmaster.

00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:26.490
I want it to snow.

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.890
Ever since I started feeding the Spirit Fire with my blood,

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:30.740
I've been having strange dreams like this again and again.

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:34.490
What could it mean?

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:49.300
Madam Yan,

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:54.050
the true killer of Noble Consort Si Xian has been found.

00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:56.820
You are free.

00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:58.970
Did His Majesty find the culprit?

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.340
Did he capture You Yan?

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:07.140
Impossible.

00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:09.050
Why not

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:12.450
ask His Majesty yourself, Madam Yan?

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:16.220
This way, please.

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:32.450
Why is it suddenly snowing?

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.740
Sima Jiao conjured the snow.

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.780
Has he regained his memories?

Yes.

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:14.220
In the years I lost my memory,

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:20.300
I came to know

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:23.140
the bitterness and pain of being left in the dark.

You secretly refined the Spirit Fire

and gave it all to me.

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:08.300
