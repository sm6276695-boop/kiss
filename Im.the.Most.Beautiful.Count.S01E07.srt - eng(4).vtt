00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.600
Once we gain power from Somdet Saenyakorn.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.400
we’ll rewrite all the laws

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.200
including the monarchy itself, right?

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.479
Prepare the troops at once

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.039
We’ll launch the war soon

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.920
I need your counsel

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.360
- Help me think this through
- About what?

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.039
Help me rally more soldiers

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.360
But first you must promise me

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.680
that you’ll join forces with me

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.720
I’ll obey your every command

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.720
Even if we’ve gained allies
from other towns

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.880
I still think it’s not enough

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.440
compared to Somdet’s army

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.680
Do you have a way to find more?

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.120
I heard that in the foothill forest

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.280
there are villagers who fled the census

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.800
to escape conscription

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.760
They’ve built their own settlement there.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.400
Those people already have rebel minds.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.360
If we persuade them well

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.520
they might join us easily.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.200
Then go make preparations now.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.880
We must depart as soon as possible.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.960
I’ll go too, Brother Kosol,
Brother Banjong.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.200
Don’t!

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.840
The road is rough.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.400
It’ll only burden you.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.720
Not at all, I like it.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.120
If everyone can go, so can I.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.600
What Kosol means is

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.960
if you come, you’ll be a burden to us.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.280
It’s better you guard the house.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.480
Brother Banjong

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.600
Instead of backing me,
you’re stopping me

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.240
Other than the two of us

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.400
who else will travel with us?

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.240
So I can prepare the right size boat

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.240
I don’t want it too noisy

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.360
Just the two of us

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.480
and Worradej, that’s enough

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.280
Worradej is quick-witted and eloquent

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.640
He can help us talk to the villagers

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.880
But if you’ve got duties

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.760
like drills or battle planning

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.880
then maybe you don’t need to come

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.720
I’ll go with Worradej myself

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.560
What is it?

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.440
Why are you staring at me?

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.000
You think I don’t know your scheme?

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.440
What scheme?

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.200
I have no scheme.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.760
Other than our work.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.680
Don’t play innocent with me.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.560
You want Worradej.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.760
So you’re angling for time alone with him.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.880
But I’ll order you right now, Banjong.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.520
Never meddle with my Worradej again.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.840
Since when did Worradej belong to you?

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.720
And what right do you
have to claim him alone?

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.240
I have the same right.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.000
Let it be up to Worradej.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.520
To choose for himself.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.720
So now you dare defy me, Banjong?

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.160
I may not dare in other matters.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.080
But when it comes to the heart.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.880
I’ll fight to the end.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.079
Why fight over Worradej?

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.880
What’s so special about him?

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.760
- Stay out of it.
- Stay out of it.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.400
We’re only traveling two days.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.240
Why pack so much stuff?

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.640
It just weighs the boat down.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.680
But it’s a trip after all.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.920
We should go all out a bit.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.840
Are you misunderstanding this?

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.000
We’re going to work, not on holiday.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.520
Work while enjoying the trip.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.000
That’s a good thing.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.720
Nothing wrong with that.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.720
Banjong is right.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.280
You should learn to chill a bit.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.720
Not frown like you’re constipated for days.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.800
Come, Banjong. Let’s check the boat.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.000
Let’s go.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.760
- I’m coming too.
- Chaiyached!

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.120
How did you get here?

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.040
I was the one who told him.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.160
Why not? Good times should be shared.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.680
Trips are for friends, right?

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.120
I told you before.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.840
If you go, you must take me too.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.480
Even if you don’t, I’ll still come.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.400
Sounds fun, right Jade?

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.760
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.200
In that case...

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.600
Please proceed, Your Majesty.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.520
Why does everyone want a trip?

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.120
Whoa!

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.680
So many lotuses, Banjong, look.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.720
Oh wow, there are birds too.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.080
What kind of bird is that?

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.920
A stork or maybe a koel?

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.120
Oh, Jade, look at that.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.720
The air’s so fresh.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.720
Pure ozone.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.600
Send a carrier pigeon to Somdet at once.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.800
Tell him

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.920
they’re sailing south.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.120
Hey, what’s that?

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.600
Looks like a monkey, but black.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.360
Where, Your Majesty?

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.440
I don’t see anything, Your Majesty.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.840
Are your eyes playing tricks,
Your Majesty?

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.200
My eyes are not deceived.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.000
Look at those bushes,
I saw it for real.

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:45.320
Which bush, Your Majesty?

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.440
- This one?
- That one.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.040
Why are you so jumpy?

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.840
A black ape, must be a gibbon.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.080
No way, it’s human-sized, Brother.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.440
Could be a beast unknown to mankind.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.400
Stop fantasizing, Chaiyached.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.640
You’re not a child anymore.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.480
Brother, trust me.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.320
Why would I make this up?

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.280
You’re just seeking attention like a child.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.640
Always calling me a child.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.600
If no one else were here,

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.920
I’d show you I’m no child anymore.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.600
Oh, even with others here,
you can show me.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.800
Worradej.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.360
I’m being serious. Don’t you see?

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.680
Then keep arguing, Your Majesty.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.000
I order you, Chaiyached.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.440
On this journey,
you must not cause trouble.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.400
I’m here on duty for the realm,

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.520
not on vacation.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.080
The rest of you, understand?

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.320
When I work, I take it seriously.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.760
But this mission lies
in the foothill village.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.920
Right now we’re en route.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.320
Why frown all the way there?

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.480
Better find some fun to ease the mood.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.560
Travel is full of danger.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.400
The boat could sink anytime.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.440
There may be whirlpools or storms.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.720
On land there are bandits and beasts.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.080
We must stay prepared at all times.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.480
Not to laze around idly.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.760
Kosol.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.280
Aren’t you being too serious?

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.800
I must be serious.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.720
If anyone argues with me again,

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.560
I’ll throw them into the river.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.960
If you want a swim, be my guest.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:43.280
Take a break!

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.080
Beyond this forest
is a city older than Thanapura.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.280
Would Your Majesty like to see it?

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.800
- Of course.
- You never stop sightseeing.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.040
There’s nothing wrong with it, Kosol.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.600
We’re resting anyway.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.400
We can eat here too.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.240
Maybe we should even camp here.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.480
Traveling at night is dangerous.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.120
Your Majesty.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.120
The meal is ready, Your Majesty.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:21.960
Jade.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.760
Go divide the food.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.920
I just want to sit with you alone.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.160
Why, Your Majesty?

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.760
It’s rare for you to dine with company.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.600
Please join everyone, Your Majesty.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.200
It’ll be much more lively.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.920
Lively? More like ruined.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.040
I don’t want to deal
with that cruel brother.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.960
I won’t sit there and be scolded again.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.520
Then where will Your Majesty dine?

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.880
Kosol.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.080
I think back on the boat,

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.600
you spoke too harshly to your brother.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.480
You should go apologize to him.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.360
Then we can all eat together.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.720
Forget it, who cares.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.480
But...

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.160
Leaving him to dine alone is...

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.680
If he falls and cracks his head,

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.040
what will you do then?

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.680
I’d say he got what he deserved.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.040
So cruel.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.400
You’re the cruelest brother,

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.600
in this life and the next.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.720
I don’t want to eat with you anymore.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.800
Worradej.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.760
My Lord, will you dine with us?

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.280
Mm, I don’t want to eat with Kosol.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.720
He’s too toxic to be around.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.400
Your Majesty, may I join you for this meal?

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.840
Please, go ahead.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.160
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.320
But wouldn’t it be better
if you came down to sit with us?

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.280
Why? The breeze up here is nice.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.400
Hmm, but talking up to you like this,

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.480
my neck’s cramping already, Your Majesty.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.160
True, Your Majesty.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.960
Banjong.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.400
Where are you going?

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.320
Stay here with me.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.480
Where I sit is my business.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.240
I’m going to sit with Worradej.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.920
Without you in the way.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.920
I’ll even feed him myself.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.560
No.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.480
- Let me go.
- Stay here with me.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.360
- Let me go, Kosol.
- Hey!

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.400
Let go.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.040
Let me go!

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.200
Banjong!

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.400
What are they doing, my Lord?

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.720
Let go!

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.920
- Let go!
- Are they wrestling?

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.400
They look so serious.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.800
Banjong!

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.280
Banjong, what happened?

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.120
I was trying to sit with you.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.200
But Kosol wouldn’t let me.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.520
He forced me to sit with him.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.480
Hmph, such a brat.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.400
Hey, don’t mind him.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.640
If he keeps acting up like this,

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.960
ignore him. Let’s just eat together.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.320
Leave the brat to dine alone.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.840
Please, Your Majesty.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.680
Sit down, Banjong. Come on.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.200
Here.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.400
I brought catfish for you.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.080
Wow, the whole fish?

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.480
I can’t finish it alone.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.240
Let’s share it then.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.480
Yeah.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.800
Keep eating, no need to go anywhere today.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.880
Forget it, let’s just keep eating.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.880
Nom nom, eat up.

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.800
Nom nom, good boy.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.560
Good boy, eat up.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.880
Nom nom, so clever.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.000
Everyone ready?

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.520
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.320
This is me

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.720
This is me

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.800
Love me for my heart

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.560
I don’t need to be like anyone else

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.280
This is me

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.800
Fabulous, everyone. Totally slayed.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.400
My Lord, if there’s a temple fair,

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.400
should we perform this dance there?

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.120
People would love it.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.560
And if anyone wants to join us,

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.560
we can teach them. A big group dance
would be so fun.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.120
Excuse me, Your Majesty.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.000
Dancing just for fun is fine.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.920
But performing before a crowd,

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.920
I’m afraid I couldn’t, Your Majesty.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.200
Hmm? What do you mean couldn’t?

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.520
You were the smoothest just now, Banjong.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.400
Yes, way smoother than me.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.200
No need to act shy.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.400
You all,

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.520
Stop chattering like scattered sparrows.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.640
There’s a pack of wolves nearby.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.800
And it’s getting dark now.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.920
If you keep being so loud,

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.160
the wolves will drag you off for dinner.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.000
Don’t mind him, everyone.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.640
Kosol just talks too much.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.360
He only wants to kill our fun.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.160
Wolves, really? How could there be?

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.920
Right, Banjong?

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.520
There are. Plenty in this forest.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.720
Jade.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.200
Go gather some firewood.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.560
I’ll light fires around to keep beasts away.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.360
Enough to last the night.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.600
Yes, sir.

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.320
I’ll come too.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.600
No need.

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.880
Do you even have
the strength to chop wood?

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.400
Chaiyached!

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.000
Chaiyached!

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.400
Kosol.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.400
Let your brother be sometimes.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.280
Don’t be so uptight.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:26.320
It’s rare for him to travel like this.

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.160
Of course he wants to
wander and look around.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.880
Don’t be so strict with him.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.560
But he’s my brother.

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.680
If something happens, who’ll take blame?

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.000
Kosol.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.120
I understand you worry for him.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.960
But if you want to keep good ties with him,

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.520
you have to let go sometimes.

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.720
If you’re too strict, it’ll only get worse.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.240
True. And besides,

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.200
he’s only going to chop wood.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.560
It’s not even dangerous.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.600
And he’s with Jade.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.680
Jade can take care of him.

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.080
Don’t overdo it.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.280
Crybaby Chet, sticky toffee butt.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.240
Rotten rice clings like toffee.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.360
Crybaby Chet, sticky toffee butt.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:19.440
Rotten rice clings like toffee.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.480
Crybaby Chet, sticky toffee butt.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.600
Crybaby Chet, sticky toffee butt.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.480
Rotten rice clings like toffee.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.320
Brother Kosol!

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.560
- Help me!
- Shameless!

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.480
Bullying someone weaker,

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.880
not worthy of royal blood.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.480
Get lost this instant!

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.800
Still not gone?

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.400
- The ogre’s here!
- Run!

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.079
Right fang!

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.800
Left fang!

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:29.160
Lower thrust!

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.080
Pull!

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.520
Left punch!

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.040
Now switch!

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.200
Right!

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.800
Swing again!

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:40.480
Right swing!

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:41.840
Left swing!

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:50.760
Harder!

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.120
Get up!

00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.360
Left punch!

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.200
Pull!

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.640
Swing!

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.000
You need to use more force!

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.240
I’m only worried about him.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:36.680
Worradej.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.960
I’ve got the firewood, sir.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.320
Jade, where’s Chaiyached?

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.560
Are you asking me, Lord Kosol?

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.840
Of course I am.

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.720
Didn’t he go gather wood with you?

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.240
No, sir. You forbade him to go.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.120
So I went alone.

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:58.560
- What?
- Then where is he?

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.480
Let’s hurry and find him!

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.880
Worradej, you come with me.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.600
Jade, you go with Kosol.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.440
Wait, Jade.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.800
You go with Banjong.

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.600
Worradej, you’re with me.

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.720
No, Jade with you is fine.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.160
Worradej must be with me.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.280
I don’t get it.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.800
Why must Worradej go with you?

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.720
Then let’s ask Worradej who he’ll choose.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.480
Worradej, who will you go with?

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.760
Uh...

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.680
Well, I...

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.560
I’ll go with...

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.680
I’ll go with anyone.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:30.960
- Then me!
- Then me!

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.240
Enough, enough!

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.600
Allow me to cut in, my Lord.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.120
So we can actually go look
for Prince Chaiyached.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.400
Prince Chaiyached!

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.200
Where are you, Your Majesty?

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.680
Prince Chaiyached!

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.760
Where are you, Your Majesty?

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.240
Hey, Jade.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:51.720
Did he ever mention running
away from the palace to you?

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.800
He never spoke of running away, my Lord.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:57.400
Only often lamented feeling
neglected by Lord Kosol.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.400
That he had come all
the way to Singhanakhon,

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.080
yet Lord Kosol
hardly paid him any mind.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.080
These two brothers, honestly...

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.880
Love or hate, who can tell?

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.160
Prince Chaiyached!

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.480
Please come out.

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.600
Where are you, Your Majesty?

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.000
Prince Chaiyached!

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.680
If you sulk too much, it won’t be cute.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.800
Where are you, Your Majesty?

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.320
Prince Chaiyached!

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:23.720
Chaiyached!

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.280
Chaiyached, where are you?

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.640
Come out this instant!

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.560
Before I lose my temper.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:32.800
Chaiyached!

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:35.600
Where does Prince Chaiyached reside?

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:38.360
If something troubles your heart,

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.880
we can calmly talk
it through, Your Majesty.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.000
Banjong.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.800
Why speak so roundabout?

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.600
Just call him Chaiyached,
short and clear.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.080
You should show
more respect to your brother.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.320
Shouting like that,

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.760
it’ll only drive him further away.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.920
He acts spoiled because you all baby him.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.880
That’s why he never grows up.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.040
Just call him “Chaiyached.”

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.040
Prince Chaiyached!

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.360
Chaiyached!

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.120
Prince Chaiyached!

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.320
Chaiyached!

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.640
King Chaiyached!

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:08.920
Chaiyached!

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.600
- Chaiyached!
- Prince Chaiyached!

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.040
- Chaiyached!
- Prince Chaiyached!

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.480
Chaiyached, where are you?

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.880
Prince Chaiyached!

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.680
Brother Chaiyached!

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.400
Please come out!

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.760
I’m about to drop dead here!

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:25.920
My Lord.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.840
You can rest here, sir.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.040
I’ll continue searching alone.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.000
No, I don’t want to be alone.

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.200
I’m scared.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.000
What are you afraid of, my Lord?

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.520
Ghosts.

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.280
Jade.

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.320
Why’d you say that?

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.760
I didn’t, my Lord.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.520
If you didn’t, then who did?

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:47.000
The ghost did.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.520
There’s nothing here.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.400
Your Majesty.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.840
What are you playing at?

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.200
Don’t you know how worried we were?

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.560
Who’s “we”?

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.160
I only saw you two searching for me.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.400
Kosol worries about you too.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.760
He just went the other way with Banjong.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.040
Please don’t stay mad at Kosol.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:24.600
Even if he acts so tough,

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:26.120
deep down,

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:28.200
he truly loves you, Your Majesty.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.840
If love means being cruel,

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.520
I’d rather not be loved at all.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.040
I won’t sleep in the tent tonight.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.680
Then where will you sleep, Your Majesty?

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.280
Somewhere in the forest.

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.680
He’s sulking.

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.200
I am not!

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.840
If you’re not sulking,

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.120
then come back with me, Your Majesty.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.960
- Jade.
- Yes, my Lord?

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:03.040
What are you doing?

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.160
Blowing the whistle.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:08.480
To signal Kosol that
we found you, Your Majesty.

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.400
Don’t.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.320
Then just come back with me, Your Majesty.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.880
Please return with us.

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.600
And when you see Kosol,

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.480
speak kindly to him.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.520
Please don’t fight.

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.440
But will he speak kindly to me?

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.880
Did you find Chaiyached?

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:38.640
Yes. He said he’ll sleep
on the boat tonight.

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.080
Hey, wait,

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.200
Kosol, where are you going?

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.200
Don’t go!

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.320
He ordered me to tell you

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.520
that we hadn’t found him yet.

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:51.200
What nonsense is this?

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.480
Let me go!

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.680
I’ll smack his head straight!

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.920
Wait, wait, Kosol!

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:59.880
He just wanted to tease you a bit.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:02.000
Why not just play along?

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.040
He just wants to see if you care for him.

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.600
Utter nonsense.

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.960
Kosol, just give in where you can.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.720
If you keep sulking back and forth,

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.480
our mission will surely fail.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.720
And what do you want me to do?

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:17.040
Hug him and kiss his forehead?

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:19.280
Not that.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.280
You have to act.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.000
Act what, exactly?

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.240
Chaiyached!

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.760
Where are you?

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.480
Come back to me quickly.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.920
If something happened to you,

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.840
how would I go on?

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.800
I promise I’ll never scold you again!

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.160
Is that enough?

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:45.000
Not yet. Put more feeling into it!

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.320
But I don’t know what else to say.

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.440
The love this brother has for you,

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:52.840
is far too great to put into words.

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:56.440
That’s why I never said it
aloud for you to hear.

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:59.920
Ridiculous! I’d never say such sickly lines!

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.080
If you don’t say it,

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.440
Prince Chaiyached will never forgive you.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.600
And if he won’t forgive you,
our mission fails.

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.240
Just say it, don’t overthink it!

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:16.680
The love this brother has for you,

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.960
is far too much to ever describe.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:22.000
That’s why I never said it
aloud for you to hear.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.120
Chaiyached, my dear brother...

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:27.200
I beg your forgiveness
from the depths of my heart.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.560
Forgive me and come back to me.

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.200
Enough yet?

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.720
I’m sorry.

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.600
I’ve been such a lame brother.

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.720
Because I’m not fabulous,

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:40.960
not chic.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.040
Not chic!

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.600
You ditch me like this, so cruel.

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:49.840
You leave me hanging like this, so cruel!

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:51.200
From now on,

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.560
I’ll be a sweet brother.

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.080
Cuddly, sparkly, glittery.

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.360
From now on,

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.160
I’ll be a sweet brother.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.440
Cuddly, sparkly, glittery.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.120
Oh, you ridiculous brother!

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.160
Chaiyached,

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:11.040
forgive your brother, please!

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:13.160
- Again?
- Again!

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.360
- Faster!
- Faster!

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.240
- Hurry up!
- You’re teasing me!

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:19.600
I’m not, hurry, hurry!

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.080
Kosol,

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.320
time to sleep.

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:41.640
We’ve got an early journey tomorrow.

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.800
Has Chaiyached eaten anything yet?

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:48.920
I saw him sneak onto the boat before dinner.

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.160
Don’t worry.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:53.120
He brought food with him on board.

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.120
Jade,

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:57.000
stay with Chaiyached tonight.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
I fear he might sleepwalk into the river.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.080
Yes, my Lord.

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.040
Worradej,

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:16.880
tonight I’ll sleep in the middle.

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:18.360
You sleep beside me.

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:19.840
Alright.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.920
Wait, Worradej!

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.600
You sleep next to me.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.080
Why should he sleep next to you?

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.440
Why should he sleep next to you?

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.880
You two better stop arguing right now.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.880
If you keep this up,

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:32.760
I’ll just run off to sleep on the boat too.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:44.080
Ugh, stop staring at each other.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.360
What are you, fighting fish?

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:46.600
Go to sleep already.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.120
Worradej,

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:53.080
I can’t fall asleep.

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.040
Talk with me a bit, will you?

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.400
Of course.

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:59.320
Strange, I can’t sleep either.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.080
That piece of paper,

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.840
have you opened it yet?

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:06.440
Till the heavens end,

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.080
the earth shall meet the stars.

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:12.000
If our love never withers,

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.480
we shall not perish.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:16.920
Though countless years may pass,

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:20.880
let passion reunite us, never apart.

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:22.880
But that poem,

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.720
why did you write it for me?

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.360
Because I wanted to make amends.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.200
I’ve realized,

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.640
love has no borders at all.

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:35.120
Anyone can love anyone.

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.640
So it’s a letter asking for another chance?

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.560
Yes.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.680
It may be short,

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.160
but my feelings inside,

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:48.840
overflow far beyond words.

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.720
Shall I write you another verse?

00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.120
Right now?

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:00.480
Right here?

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:03.080
Oh my god...

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:05.280
is this an ancient nerd’s way,

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.720
of asking someone to be their lover?

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.160
And here of all places?

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.240
Though I may be,

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:19.680
a vast ocean deep...

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:23.200
let me meet you in joy,

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.960
as a humble fish.

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:29.360
If you’re a lotus,

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.520
then I’ll be the pond itself,

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.320
cradling your beauty, golden bloom.

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:37.960
Golden lotus.

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.520
Ugh!

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:41.320
How long will you two keep talking?

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.080
Show some respect for others!

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.280
I’m trying to sleep!

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:46.080
Worradej,

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.640
what do you think of it?

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.160
The poem, I mean?

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:52.640
It’s beautiful. I like it.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:56.400
I mean the message I wish to send you.

00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:58.600
Could we truly be together,

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.840
as the poem describes?

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:04.320
Kosol.

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:06.320
Kosol.

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.040
Hey, what are you doing?

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.440
We’re in the middle of talking.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.640
I don’t know. I’m asleep already.

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:24.600
Banjong, maybe we should talk later.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.320
Let’s sleep for now.

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.400
Whenever you have an answer,

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.280
just give it to me then.

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:31.880
I won’t pressure you.

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.360
Sleep well.

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.280
Help!

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:48.960
Somebody get me out of here!

00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:59.080
Your Majesty.

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:01.080
Still not asleep yet?

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.760
I can’t fall asleep.

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.000
Come sit here with me.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.520
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.320
And what brings you here?

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:13.760
I came to keep you company.

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.480
So if you need anything, I’ll be here.

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.160
Don’t try to fool me.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.160
Kosol sent you here, didn’t he?

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:24.120
Did you know, Your Majesty,

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:27.240
that Lord Kosol already knows you’re here?

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.280
That’s not hard to guess.

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:32.800
That play my brother put on just now
was hardly convincing.

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:34.200
Kosol?

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:37.000
Speaking so tenderly about me?
Impossible.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:41.280
Though Lord Kosol may seem a bit stern,

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:42.880
I can tell,

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:45.920
he truly does care for Your Majesty.

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:49.840
Drop the subject already.

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:51.720
Jes.

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:54.160
Thank you for keeping me company.

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.120
I thought I’d be alone tonight.

00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:58.600
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:03.200
At first I meant to chat
with the ones on the boat,

00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:05.800
but they all fell asleep so early.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.960
Come to think of it,
you fall asleep easily, don’t you?

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:19.720
Jes.

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:21.800
Jes.

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.840
You fall asleep far too quickly.

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.280
Alright, everyone.

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:54.760
After the meal, we’ll continue our journey.

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:56.880
Please enjoy your food.

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.920
Here, this is the moment.

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.440
Say the lines we rehearsed last night.

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:07.920
Really?

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.120
Maybe it’s not needed.

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:10.320
It is.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.560
It’ll finally lift the mood.

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:15.760
Don’t you see how gloomy it’s been?

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.800
Like dark clouds hovering all the time.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.199
Just say it.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.600
Alright.

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:29.040
Brother Chet, my dear.

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.920
Where were you last night?

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:32.320
Do you know

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.679
I missed you so much it broke my heart?

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:37.480
From now on I’ll speak kindly to you.

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:40.480
Please don’t be mad at me.

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:43.239
Hehe.

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:46.040
Hehe.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.679
I’m not mad at you anymore.

00:34:56.159 --> 00:34:57.560
Fabulous.

00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:00.200
Now the mood of this journey

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:04.320
will be bright and sparkling again.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.080
Whoever ruins the mood next,

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:10.520
I’ll smack them till they bend over.

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:14.680
Since we’re here, let’s celebrate a little.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.320
Alright, everyone

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:20.400
Clap it up, nonstop

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:23.520
Clap, clap, keep it rolling

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:26.800
Faster!

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:30.280
One, two, one two three,
one two, one two, one

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:33.520
Clap!

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.920
Alright, let’s get back to eating

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:57.080
Has Lord Banjong sent any word?

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:02.000
He only left a short while ago

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.840
Why do you ask, has something happened?

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:10.400
Our spies report that Somdet Saenyakorn

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:13.160
sent men to shadow Kosol’s group closely

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.040
What?

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:18.080
I fear both Kosol and Banjong

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:20.360
may be in danger on the road

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:26.440
Even the route to the mountain
village is perilous enough

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:28.640
And now Somdet’s men too?

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:34.280
Heaven help us

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.560
May Kosol and Banjong

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:39.440
be kept safe from harm

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:54.000
The night before we set out,
I spoke with Banjong

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.200
and I think you all need to
know this as well

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.440
Right now we’re here

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:01.600
and we’re heading
for the mountain village here

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:04.160
To get there, we must cross the river

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.760
Through forests, across mountains

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:10.560
So how long must we walk the forest?

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.520
How long will it take, Kosol?

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.280
About one full day, I’d say

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:22.480
Everyone, watch your step

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.160
Once we make it ashore

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.960
I want you all to be extra cautious

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.760
There are beasts and
bandits in these woods

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:32.840
If we let our guard down

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:34.720
danger could strike anytime

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.600
Any questions?

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:40.760
Whatever you say, we’ll follow

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:43.440
- Ah!
- My lord!

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:45.120
Lord Kosol!

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.400
Worradej!

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.680
Hang on just a bit longer

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:50.800
Once we’re past this ridge, we’re there

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.440
Government men

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:56.880
We must take them out

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.920
before they find our village

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:03.520
How can we fight them?
There are five of them.

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.720
Go back to the village

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:07.960
Bring explosives

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:11.040
One blast, and they’ll all die together

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:12.920
Go, quickly!

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:18.600
There are people nearby

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:19.800
They must be bandits

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.160
We must leave at once

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.600
Go quickly

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.000
Hurry, move!

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:43.280
We need to be more cautious

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.680
Keep eyes and ears sharp

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.480
Danger is all around us

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:50.720
You never told me
it would be this dangerous

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.520
Kosol, you’re too paranoid

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:55.960
Just hearing footsteps,
you assume it’s an enemy

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:11.720
We must get out of this area fast

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:14.840
Stay together and follow me.

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:15.880
Go!

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:17.680
Move!

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:20.080
Quickly!

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.000
Careful!

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:50.920
Hey, everyone

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:54.080
Officials are coming, hide inside!

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:56.640
Phai is stalling them off

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:58.520
The rest of you, get ready!

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.760
They’ve lured us into a trap

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:16.800
We must escape before they arrive

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:19.040
It’s too steep, how do we climb up?

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:24.640
Jet, do the pom-pom hands I taught you

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:25.760
Yes, sir

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:30.080
Kosol, don’t just stand
there Do it too, quick!

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:33.880
Master, be careful!

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:35.120
- One
- Yes, sir

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:38.360
Two Three

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.600
Who wants to die first Speak up

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.520
Master!

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.400
What is this about, brother?

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.080
We can talk it through calmly.

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.600
Why kill us?

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:53.080
I don’t want to kill you

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:56.320
I only want to protect myself and my people

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:59.720
You’re from the village
that fled conscription, aren’t you?

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:02.360
Yes And you’re officials

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.440
Come to drag us back, right?

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:07.280
No, we’re not government men

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:10.400
We came to ask you to join us against them

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:13.080
So you can live free the way you want

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:15.720
Not hiding in the forest like this

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:17.080
I don’t believe you

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:19.880
Then what must we do for you to believe?

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:21.640
Want me to swear an oath?

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:25.000
Is there a temple nearby
So I can swear properly?

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:27.560
Hey

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:30.680
Are you Count Worradej?

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:33.520
Yes, I am Count Worradej

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:34.680
But...

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.840
Do we know each other?

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:43.880
Phai!

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:46.080
Phai!

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:50.440
Is this Phai’s house?

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.200
Yes

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:53.480
I’m Phai

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:54.960
What business do you have, my lord?

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:57.400
You’re enlisted under the military

00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:01.040
It’s time for your month of service
but you haven’t reported

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:03.440
I was assigned to bring you in

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:07.960
Come with me now

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.120
I can’t go

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:12.240
Please spare me this time, my lord

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:14.040
Why can’t you go?

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.960
My mother is gravely ill

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.920
Both my brothers are already serving

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:34.080
And my sister sold herself

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:37.760
She became Lord Anuchit’s slave last year

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:41.400
Now only I’m left to care for our mother

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.160
Please have mercy on me, Count

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:48.280
When my mother recovers
I’ll report immediately

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:52.960
I’ll just report to the officials
that I couldn’t find you

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:57.000
For now, keep yourself hidden
Don’t let anyone see you

00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:59.960
Thank you, Count Thank you so much

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:07.960
That favor back then

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:10.320
I still remember it clearly

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:17.200
Of course you do

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.120
Something that important

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:20.560
Who could ever forget?

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:22.160
Anyway, now

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.880
How about helping us climb up, hm?

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.800
Your village looks so lovely

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.640
So quiet and peaceful

00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:56.800
Phai!

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:00.560
Did you betray us
and side with the officials?

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.200
Attack!

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:37.520
Have you forgotten, Your Highness?

00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:39.000
He’s the traitor!

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.880
This time you all must train
to fight properly

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:44.240
That bastard Somdet will
march his army soon

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:46.720
Start with Jet as the tank

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:48.520
Your Highness as the medic

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:49.960
Banjong as the carry

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:51.720
Kosol as the assassin

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:55.160
You’ll have to find a way
to strike Somdet down

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:56.480
Let me ask you something

00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:59.320
Before and after you drink poison…

00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:01.080
It’s like you’re a whole other person

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:03.720
So which version of me do you love?

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:10.440
(The wedding procession is here!)

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:16.240
(Gotta carry the dowry tray no matter what)

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.200
Who’s got a kaffir lime
to trade for a lemon?

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:29.520
(So this counts as ready, huh?)

00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:31.680
Oops, I forgot

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:33.680
I swear the original dance was different

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:35.440
(So how are you teaching others?)
