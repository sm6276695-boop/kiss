00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:11.011
Answer the fucking phone. You… Shit.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.394
Okay. All right.

00:00:20.062 --> 00:00:21.271
Let's go.

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:23.273
What…

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:26.652
You really didn't know
that the client was Kim Hansang?

00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:28.237
I told you, man. I didn't know.

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:33.075
Okay, okay. I heard it was someone else.

00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:34.201
Who was it?

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:37.663
Some American woman named Stella Young.

00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.668
Find out everything about her.

00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:44.253
I mean, everything.

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:46.338
Don't leave a single thing out.

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:47.506
You do that,

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:49.716
and I'll let you retire in peace.

00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:52.094
Yeah. Yes. Yes!

00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:02.145
Miji, can you come pick me up?

00:01:02.646 --> 00:01:03.730
Where are you?

00:01:03.814 --> 00:01:05.649
I was actually gonna call you.

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:07.234
We got in touch with Anderson.

00:01:10.404 --> 00:01:12.155
You remember Hassan, right?

00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:16.201
I told him about your situation,
and he insisted you stay at his place.

00:01:16.285 --> 00:01:17.995
He's in the States right now
staying at my place.

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:20.664
He said he had the room cleaned
and the bedsheets changed for you.

00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:24.126
Is this real?

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:28.672
'Cause this matches
the crew members' description exactly.

00:01:30.382 --> 00:01:32.676
I ran it through
a deepfake detection program,

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.345
and there's a 98% chance
that the video is real.

00:01:36.138 --> 00:01:39.808
So the submarine really exists?

00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:43.228
Yesterday, I got word that
the submarine's chief engineer,

00:01:43.312 --> 00:01:46.231
the one that got shot,
woke up after his surgery.

00:01:46.315 --> 00:01:47.983
That submarine

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:50.610
definitely isn't fake.

00:01:50.694 --> 00:01:51.862
I… I saw it.

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:55.115
He said for the past five years,

00:01:56.074 --> 00:02:00.329
they have been building
two submarines simultaneously

00:02:00.412 --> 00:02:01.747
at Youngpo Shipyard.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.249
The one that they unveiled
is a modified version

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:06.251
of an older Russian model,

00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:09.087
and the real one, the nuclear one,

00:02:10.047 --> 00:02:13.050
is hidden somewhere below.

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:23.894
Don't move! Don't fucking move!

00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:29.691
He also said…

00:02:29.775 --> 00:02:31.276
I'm sorry, Chief.

00:02:31.777 --> 00:02:33.445
…after their initial testimony,

00:02:33.528 --> 00:02:35.947
- somebody got to that young crew member…
- I'm sorry.

00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:38.408
…and ordered him to shoot his comrades.

00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:40.452
So I emailed my FBI contact

00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:41.912
asking him what's going on.

00:02:43.622 --> 00:02:45.791
He said he never sent me anything.

00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:48.960
He doesn't know anything about it.
He doesn't have a record of it.

00:02:49.044 --> 00:02:51.088
Somebody sent me that video.

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:54.800
Why? I think it's because
I'm the only Korean-American

00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:56.134
on the Security Council.

00:02:56.218 --> 00:03:00.013
They think I'm gonna do anything
to prove there is no submarine

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:01.973
to prevent a war.

00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:14.736
{\an8}An endless line of trucks
carrying food and other basic necessities

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.823
{\an8}continues to move across
the New Amnok River Bridge

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:21.535
between Sinuiju in North Korea
and Dandong in China.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.498
In China, the 139th and 202nd Group Armies

00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:28.834
have started moving toward the border.

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:31.503
The North Sea Fleet's also on the move.

00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:36.174
The war seems inevitable.

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:40.637
No preemptive strikes, Terry.

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:43.515
The US cannot go to war
without justification.

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:46.810
Well, we will have confirmation
of the submarine's existence shortly--

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:49.312
Enough with the goddamn submarine.
I don't want to hear it, okay?

00:03:52.816 --> 00:03:55.986
- What have they decided?
- Well, Russia's still on the fence.

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.781
We're on the edge of a crisis where

00:03:59.865 --> 00:04:02.993
the slightest misstep could start a war.

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:06.872
And North Korea will make a mistake.

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:07.956
Soon.

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:12.335
We just need to be ready to act
when that happens.

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:31.396
TEMPEST

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.108
Do you think someone
used Anderson and the ambassador

00:04:35.192 --> 00:04:37.986
to stop the submarine
from being destroyed?

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:40.322
Every piece of information
Anderson has given us

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:42.282
is something only he can verify.

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:44.451
We have no way to verify the information
here in Korea.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.161
None of it.

00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:49.498
Not Stella Young's contracts
or his FBI contact.

00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:53.335
What if Anderson used Mr. Jang to keep
the submarine from getting destroyed?

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:55.420
Then he used his friend…

00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:59.174
He used him and got him murdered.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.802
How could he do that?

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:04.095
Let's go back and rethink everything.

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:08.141
No, please don't, ma'am.

00:05:08.225 --> 00:05:09.518
Why?

00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:11.603
You're thinking about going there,
aren't you?

00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:15.106
You want to go to Geumseol Port so you can
find out the truth about the submarine.

00:05:16.358 --> 00:05:18.109
- Miji.
- I don't care anymore

00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:19.528
whether the submarine exists or not.

00:05:19.611 --> 00:05:22.030
How many people have died because of this?

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:24.950
You have to leave right now.

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:26.368
And go where, Miji?

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:28.995
The NIS and the police are after her.

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:30.747
She must be on the no-fly list.

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:33.875
What about a ship?

00:05:35.836 --> 00:05:37.337
You want her to stow away on a ship?

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.340
It'd be difficult for most people,
yes, but…

00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:44.094
I know I'm able to make it happen.
I'll come up with the perfect plan.

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:47.848
This is an embassy employee's residence,
it'll be safe to stay here for a few days,

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:49.599
but you can't stay any longer than that.

00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:52.018
Excuse me.

00:05:53.854 --> 00:05:55.397
Hello? Hassan?

00:05:55.981 --> 00:05:58.483
By the way,
about the boat we talked about last time…

00:05:58.567 --> 00:06:00.068
What do you want to do, Ms. Seo?

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:02.821
If I don't uncover the truth
about the submarine,

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:05.407
I'll become a traitor
who betrayed her country.

00:06:06.575 --> 00:06:10.996
I need to find out who asked me
to be there and why.

00:06:12.622 --> 00:06:14.291
Help me, Changhee.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.502
Help me get to Geumseol Port.

00:06:27.762 --> 00:06:28.930
It's too complex.

00:06:29.014 --> 00:06:30.932
I don't think I'll be able to
cover it alone.

00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:35.020
Let me just check it out first.

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:20.607
Who ordered you to come here this time?

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:26.821
Why did you do that to me?

00:07:27.322 --> 00:07:28.490
Why go that far?

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:32.994
Why did you make me need you?

00:07:33.078 --> 00:07:34.746
Make me want to run away with you?

00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:38.875
Was that also part of your plan?

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.629
Why did you lie to me, Sanho?

00:07:45.548 --> 00:07:47.217
I didn't want you to get killed.

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:52.305
Who's there?

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:55.725
- Who said you could be here?
- You can't be here, all right?

00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:57.727
- Right, I'm sorry.
- This area is restricted to the public.

00:07:57.811 --> 00:07:59.979
- Get out!
- Get out of there! Now!

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:07.278
I was the one who needed you.

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:12.617
I wanted to run away with you.

00:08:16.246 --> 00:08:17.247
I'm sorry.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.332
Everyone who tried their best to kill me,

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:23.586
Kim Hansang, the NIS,
but more than any of them,

00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:27.173
I was angry with you the most.

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:31.886
But I'm grateful for one thing.

00:08:32.971 --> 00:08:34.723
When I was completely broken,

00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:37.726
you gave me this.

00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:45.358
You taught me that I'm the one
who has to protect myself.

00:08:45.442 --> 00:08:47.444
No one else can do it for me.

00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:54.534
"The one who shoots first
gets to go home," right?

00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:01.541
If you follow me, I'll shoot.

00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:07.130
I was at my weakest when I trusted you.

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:14.471
I refuse to be weak again.

00:09:54.969 --> 00:09:59.390
Ms. Seo,
is Mr. Paik Sanho ever coming back?

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:03.019
You were right about him, Changhee.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.397
Bad things happen wherever he goes.

00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:07.816
You won't see him again.

00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:14.823
I know I was suspicious of him initially,
but I think I was wrong.

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:19.536
I'm worried that you could be in danger
with just me helping you.

00:10:20.662 --> 00:10:23.164
- With Mr. Paik, you'd be more--
- Right now,

00:10:23.248 --> 00:10:25.166
my safety doesn't matter to me.

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:29.462
I'm not gonna let my feelings
jeopardize what's most important.

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:44.769
Could you pull over for a second?
I don't feel good.

00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:47.438
Let me step outside alone.

00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:49.232
Sure, yeah.

00:10:59.117 --> 00:11:01.703
CHAIRWOMAN LIM OKSEON

00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:03.163
DECLINE

00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:55.840
RECENT CALLS

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.858
Find out everything about Stella Young.

00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:17.070
I want every arms deal contract,
her history,

00:12:17.153 --> 00:12:19.030
who she met with, where she's been.

00:12:19.113 --> 00:12:22.033
All the records of her movements.
I want it all.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.168
INCOMING MAIL

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.884
KIM YONGJUN

00:14:03.217 --> 00:14:05.720
Oh. Uh, we've got a problem, Ms. Seo.

00:14:05.803 --> 00:14:09.474
Do you remember José Kim,
the lawyer for Shiv Holdings?

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:13.853
My name is José Kim,
corporate lawyer for Shiv Holdings.

00:14:13.936 --> 00:14:16.731
We were supposed to meet him
a few days ago.

00:14:26.616 --> 00:14:29.118
But with all the chaos
from the nationwide alert…

00:14:31.412 --> 00:14:32.413
EMERGENCY ALERT

00:14:32.497 --> 00:14:33.998
PLEASE PREPARE
FOR IMMEDIATE EVACUATION

00:14:39.754 --> 00:14:42.507
I completely forgot about the appointment.

00:14:48.054 --> 00:14:50.264
It looks like
he's been waiting all this time.

00:14:51.974 --> 00:14:53.810
He came all the way from Argentina.

00:14:55.019 --> 00:14:56.187
What should we do?

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:05.571
Um, Mr. José Kim?

00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:08.407
- Miji?
- Oh, please get in.

00:15:08.491 --> 00:15:09.492
Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:15:10.827 --> 00:15:12.829
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

00:15:14.163 --> 00:15:16.666
I'm visiting Seoul
for the first time in 30 years.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:18.584
Excuse me.

00:15:24.173 --> 00:15:28.803
My father took me and my family to
the Southern Hemisphere to escape the war.

00:15:28.886 --> 00:15:31.305
Figures that just as I arrive…

00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:35.768
I have offices in Panama
and in Buenos Aires.

00:15:40.565 --> 00:15:44.402
Five years ago, I was approached
by Mr. Jang Junik's representative

00:15:44.485 --> 00:15:47.155
to set up four shell companies in Panama.

00:15:48.239 --> 00:15:50.074
Through these companies,

00:15:50.158 --> 00:15:54.662
Mr. Jang wanted to acquire
real estate in Argentina.

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:57.540
A massive amount of land.

00:15:57.623 --> 00:16:00.209
To be honest,
that had always been my dream.

00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:02.837
To build a large farm
in the Pampas of Argentina

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.256
and live as an unnamed gaucho.

00:16:05.339 --> 00:16:10.511
So I secretly grew to love acquiring
and managing land on his behalf.

00:16:11.095 --> 00:16:12.513
Then one day…

00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:17.852
Did you see the news?
Jang Junik was shot and killed yesterday.

00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:20.938
What?
Jang Junik, the presidential candidate?

00:16:21.022 --> 00:16:23.024
Someone assassinated a candidate?

00:16:23.107 --> 00:16:24.817
What's going on in Korea?

00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:27.737
I heard it was some
anti-reunification fanatic who killed him.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:30.990
I heard that a South Korean
presidential candidate named Jang Junik

00:16:31.073 --> 00:16:32.533
had been assassinated.

00:16:33.409 --> 00:16:36.329
And I realized that
the man who had been killed

00:16:36.412 --> 00:16:39.665
was the same Jang Junik
that I had been working for.

00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:41.459
{\an8}PYEONGCHEON-RO,
SEONGWON-GU, SEOUL

00:16:41.542 --> 00:16:42.877
I was in total disarray.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.337
Because just the week before,

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:48.216
I had finalized a real estate contract
in his name

00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:50.927
and was scheduled
to make the final payment soon.

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:54.138
Thank you.

00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:57.183
I was still exchanging emails
with his representative too.

00:16:57.266 --> 00:17:00.102
{\an8}Then when I saw the news
that you, his widow,

00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:02.688
had been the target of a bomb attack,

00:17:02.772 --> 00:17:05.233
everything became as clear as day.

00:17:05.733 --> 00:17:08.152
The Korean media believes
there's political motives

00:17:08.236 --> 00:17:10.404
behind the assassination and the attack,

00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:14.033
but as a lawyer with 25 years
of experience, I see only one reason.

00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:20.957
- It's about the inheritance.
- Hmm?

00:17:21.832 --> 00:17:24.418
Are you talking about
the inheritance of his land in Argentina?

00:17:24.502 --> 00:17:28.839
The four shell companies in Panama
owned by Mr. Jang Junik

00:17:28.923 --> 00:17:32.009
currently hold assets
worth approximately two trillion won.

00:17:34.262 --> 00:17:37.807
Ms. Seo, you probably would've
contacted me had you been aware.

00:17:38.766 --> 00:17:40.768
But even at this moment,

00:17:40.851 --> 00:17:44.772
someone out there is still pretending
like Mr. Jang's alive and breathing.

00:17:44.855 --> 00:17:46.274
Who do you think it is?

00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:50.611
Well, as far as I know,
you haven't had any children,

00:17:50.695 --> 00:17:53.531
but do you have any other family?

00:17:54.365 --> 00:17:56.033
My parents are gone
and I have no siblings.

00:17:56.117 --> 00:17:58.786
I don't know much
about my relatives either.

00:17:58.869 --> 00:18:00.830
But my husband, Jang Junik,

00:18:01.497 --> 00:18:02.707
has a son.

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:04.917
Ah, I wasn't aware of that.

00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:07.503
Then it must be someone connected
to that child.

00:18:07.587 --> 00:18:08.754
Just so you know,

00:18:08.838 --> 00:18:11.632
before coming here, I looked into
Mr. Jang's representative.

00:18:12.508 --> 00:18:13.509
The one who handled

00:18:13.593 --> 00:18:16.470
the real estate dealings
in Argentina on behalf of him.

00:18:18.639 --> 00:18:20.975
And I found out Stella Young is her name.

00:18:21.058 --> 00:18:22.893
Huh? Seriously? What?

00:18:23.686 --> 00:18:25.896
- What? What is it?
- That…

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.732
She's the child's mother.

00:18:31.193 --> 00:18:33.529
Oh, okay.

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.959
How do you feel about
being questioned by the police?

00:18:47.043 --> 00:18:49.170
So what exactly made you decide
to leak the private recording?

00:18:49.253 --> 00:18:50.755
Do you have anything to say
to Ms. Seo Munju?

00:18:50.838 --> 00:18:52.715
A woman in her 30s identified as Kang

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:54.383
has appeared before the police
for questioning

00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:56.302
{\an8}over allegations of leaking
a private recording

00:18:56.385 --> 00:18:59.055
{\an8}of the New Republic Party
presidential candidate Seo Munju

00:18:59.138 --> 00:19:00.181
{\an8}and her bodyguard, Paik.

00:19:00.264 --> 00:19:02.308
{\an8}- What was your intention?
What's your relationship with…

00:19:02.391 --> 00:19:03.893
{\an8}My name is Kang Hanna.

00:19:05.144 --> 00:19:08.397
{\an8}It's true that I informed the media
about the relationship

00:19:09.732 --> 00:19:11.901
between Seo Munju

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:15.488
and Paik Sanho because

00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:18.824
the late Assemblyman Jang Junik
and I were in love.

00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:23.162
We have a child.

00:19:23.245 --> 00:19:25.706
A nine-year-old boy
who looks exactly like him.

00:19:28.959 --> 00:19:31.545
{\an8}Are you saying you were in a
relationship with Mr. Jang until recently?

00:19:31.629 --> 00:19:34.048
Can you tell us whether
he was aware of this child's existence?

00:19:34.131 --> 00:19:36.175
- Grandma.
- When exactly did your affair

00:19:36.258 --> 00:19:37.677
- with Mr. Jang begin?
- Does Seo Mun--

00:19:39.887 --> 00:19:41.806
- Yeah?
- Mom isn't here.

00:19:42.431 --> 00:19:45.184
Where did she go? Hmm?

00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:48.521
What if Mom doesn't come home?

00:19:48.604 --> 00:19:50.606
She always comes right back, doesn't she?

00:19:51.399 --> 00:19:52.983
But what if she doesn't this time?

00:19:56.779 --> 00:19:57.905
Eunseong,

00:19:58.614 --> 00:20:02.993
a child is able to live
without their mother.

00:20:03.953 --> 00:20:06.622
And I'm here to make sure
you're protected.

00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:10.918
I raised your father the same way
I'm raising you right now.

00:20:13.254 --> 00:20:15.256
The reason that I leaked the recording

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:20.219
is that I believe they are the ones
that are responsible

00:20:20.302 --> 00:20:22.388
for my beloved Junik's untimely death.

00:20:22.471 --> 00:20:24.223
Is she saying Seo Munju killed him?

00:20:24.306 --> 00:20:26.058
Could North Korea be involved?

00:20:26.142 --> 00:20:29.812
Are you saying that Ms. Seo
was directly involved in Mr. Jang's death?

00:20:29.895 --> 00:20:31.105
Do you have any evidence?

00:20:31.188 --> 00:20:32.690
I intend to fully cooperate

00:20:32.773 --> 00:20:36.068
with the police in their investigation
of my own wrongdoing. But after that,

00:20:36.152 --> 00:20:38.070
I'll pass on all the evidence
I've gathered

00:20:38.154 --> 00:20:39.989
regarding Seo Munju's involvement
in the killing

00:20:40.072 --> 00:20:43.743
and make sure that those responsible
are immediately held accountable.

00:20:43.826 --> 00:20:45.369
{\an8}Miss Kang, over here, please.

00:20:45.453 --> 00:20:47.747
{\an8}

00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:53.794
{\an8}

00:21:00.342 --> 00:21:01.844
Oh, wow.

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:07.391
It really wasn't easy for me
to come here, you know.

00:21:07.475 --> 00:21:10.728
But when I realized
that I was the only one

00:21:10.811 --> 00:21:12.646
who knew the secret
worth two trillion won,

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:17.318
and the only one who was able to
protect all of Ms. Seo's assets…

00:21:18.736 --> 00:21:21.864
- I found the courage to come.
- Thank you.

00:21:21.947 --> 00:21:23.282
I'm one step closer to getting

00:21:23.365 --> 00:21:25.868
all the facts about my husband's murder
because of you.

00:21:25.951 --> 00:21:30.998
I usually charge a commission,
about 3 to 5%, but…

00:21:31.707 --> 00:21:33.292
I'll offer you a special rate.

00:21:33.375 --> 00:21:35.586
From the total amount,
I'll just charge 2%.

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:37.797
Huh?

00:21:42.593 --> 00:21:44.678
How about we make it 1%?

00:21:45.262 --> 00:21:49.058
1% of 2 trillion won?
So you mean 20 billion?

00:21:50.142 --> 00:21:51.352
The thing is,

00:21:52.144 --> 00:21:53.646
I really don't think the inheritance

00:21:53.729 --> 00:21:56.232
was the only reason
Stella Young tried to kill me.

00:21:57.233 --> 00:22:01.529
I'm not related to my husband's child,
so even if I die,

00:22:01.612 --> 00:22:03.697
he wouldn't get a share
of the inheritance.

00:22:05.616 --> 00:22:07.535
Well, that is accurate, but…

00:22:08.828 --> 00:22:12.498
they still could try to resort to
some illegal methods

00:22:12.581 --> 00:22:13.791
to erase you from the picture--

00:22:13.874 --> 00:22:15.668
I'll give you a 5% commission, Mr. Kim.

00:22:16.502 --> 00:22:18.838
- Jeez.
- Why?

00:22:19.338 --> 00:22:23.759
To you, that money seems like
an amount to kill for, but for me…

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:26.178
this is worth so much more.

00:22:26.262 --> 00:22:28.639
Okay. What do you mean by that?

00:22:29.139 --> 00:22:32.685
Send Mr. Kim all the contracts Stella
Young has signed over the last five years

00:22:32.768 --> 00:22:34.186
and her transaction details.

00:22:34.937 --> 00:22:36.021
Yes, ma'am.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:43.279
Do you think you'd be able to trace
the transactions of those shell companies

00:22:43.362 --> 00:22:46.490
and then find out
where all the money came from?

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:56.083
I'll do the best I can.

00:23:56.268 --> 00:23:57.937
I'm looking for Stella Young.

00:24:00.105 --> 00:24:01.690
And who is that?

00:24:03.359 --> 00:24:05.194
The woman who's spent the last five years

00:24:05.277 --> 00:24:07.780
traveling the world
acquiring submarine parts.

00:24:09.657 --> 00:24:12.117
The one with connections
to high-ranking Russian officials.

00:24:12.993 --> 00:24:16.497
The one who hired me through Valkyrie
to keep an eye on Seo Munju.

00:24:20.501 --> 00:24:22.002
Well, she sounds interesting.

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:25.172
You think that I'm her?

00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:28.717
Your real name's Jeon Sukhyang.

00:24:29.551 --> 00:24:32.054
Daughter of North Korea's ambassador
to Russia.

00:24:32.137 --> 00:24:34.890
You defected to the US
with your family at 16.

00:24:34.974 --> 00:24:37.685
By 19, you were working
as a CIA contractor,

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:42.982
{\an8}operating under various identities
across Romania, Hungary, and Poland.

00:24:46.986 --> 00:24:49.488
But many people know you as Stella Young.

00:24:52.157 --> 00:24:56.328
How do you think a… woman like that
could speak in front of the press

00:24:56.412 --> 00:24:59.081
and let herself get humiliated
over a man she loved?

00:25:00.207 --> 00:25:01.709
Because of the inheritance?

00:25:05.254 --> 00:25:06.922
Even if Seo Munju dies,

00:25:07.631 --> 00:25:10.759
Eunseong still won't inherit
Jang Junik's entire estate.

00:25:11.844 --> 00:25:14.513
There's only one way
to make sure Eunseong gets it.

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:19.435
If Seo Munju was the one
who murdered Jang Junik.

00:25:20.728 --> 00:25:23.605
It won't be because of me
if she turns out to be the killer.

00:25:24.314 --> 00:25:25.482
It'll be the evidence.

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.069
I'm sure you planted
some evidence already,

00:25:30.487 --> 00:25:32.531
just like you were able to
plan the murder.

00:25:33.532 --> 00:25:35.534
Even Stella Young couldn't have killed

00:25:36.869 --> 00:25:40.205
the man she loved,
wouldn't you agree, sir?

00:25:43.667 --> 00:25:44.752
I just wanted

00:25:46.545 --> 00:25:48.380
to be able to beat her for once.

00:25:52.468 --> 00:25:55.387
Seo Munju and I were tied,

00:25:55.471 --> 00:25:56.513
1-1.

00:25:58.682 --> 00:26:00.517
Junik loved her and they were married,

00:26:01.685 --> 00:26:04.104
but I got to bear his first-born son.

00:26:05.022 --> 00:26:06.982
I wanted to show the world

00:26:07.066 --> 00:26:09.401
that I was actually the woman he loved.

00:26:11.862 --> 00:26:14.323
Then very quickly, it's 2-0, right?

00:26:21.371 --> 00:26:23.582
You're not the Stella Young
I'm looking for.

00:26:24.875 --> 00:26:26.960
On the same day
Stella Young signed a contract

00:26:27.044 --> 00:26:28.545
with a Russian underwater drone company…

00:26:32.591 --> 00:26:35.511
She signed another contract
for structural steel plates in Poland.

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:40.057
Even with a private jet, it wouldn't have
been possible to travel that distance.

00:26:41.642 --> 00:26:44.895
And on the day she met
with Valkyrie's CEO in New York…

00:26:50.317 --> 00:26:51.652
DATE: SEPTEMBER 17, 2025

00:26:52.444 --> 00:26:53.821
You were in Korea.

00:26:56.573 --> 00:26:57.741
Who are you?

00:26:59.034 --> 00:27:00.035
Is your name…

00:27:02.204 --> 00:27:03.580
Stella Young?

00:27:08.544 --> 00:27:10.629
So tell me, doesn't that mean…

00:27:17.678 --> 00:27:19.680
there's at least two Stella Youngs?

00:27:59.845 --> 00:28:02.014
Is there someone that you're afraid of?

00:28:03.515 --> 00:28:06.852
Someone who might wanna take you out
when you're no longer of use?

00:28:20.616 --> 00:28:22.367
Who's the real Stella Young?

00:28:24.328 --> 00:28:26.246
And think very carefully…

00:28:27.956 --> 00:28:30.292
…about how you and Eunseong
can survive all this.

00:28:32.878 --> 00:28:34.463
I could protect you and him.

00:28:43.639 --> 00:28:44.640
Ms. Seo.

00:28:45.474 --> 00:28:46.475
Ah.

00:28:47.434 --> 00:28:49.269
I need to bring something up.

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:52.981
Truth is…

00:28:55.317 --> 00:28:57.235
I was suspicious of you

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:01.406
when I found out that you inherited
all of Mr. Jang's estate.

00:29:03.659 --> 00:29:04.743
I understand.

00:29:04.826 --> 00:29:05.953
So…

00:29:08.413 --> 00:29:09.748
when his mother asked,

00:29:09.831 --> 00:29:12.751
I stole your phone, put an app on it,
and then I gave her…

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:16.338
I gave her cloud access
to the wiretap recordings.

00:29:17.798 --> 00:29:19.967
I'm sorry, Ms. Seo.

00:29:21.969 --> 00:29:23.804
I just wanted to find out

00:29:25.138 --> 00:29:27.391
who was behind Mr. Jang's murder.

00:29:31.687 --> 00:29:34.523
Were you aware
that I was wiretapping Mr. Paik Sanho?

00:29:36.358 --> 00:29:38.610
I never listened to the recordings.

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:42.864
Back then…

00:29:44.574 --> 00:29:49.162
- Ms. Lim gave me a watch and…
- Give me your hand.

00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:52.374
I remember thinking,

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:58.171
"What kind of person would give me
such an expensive watch?"

00:30:05.762 --> 00:30:06.763
YU SEONGJIN
SECURITY ON

00:30:06.847 --> 00:30:07.848
DEACTIVATED

00:30:41.131 --> 00:30:42.883
Surprised you got in here.

00:30:43.467 --> 00:30:45.802
This is the most secure hospital
in South Korea.

00:30:46.386 --> 00:30:49.181
Why is the NIS accusing Seo Munju
of being a spy?

00:30:55.228 --> 00:30:59.274
We consider anyone who acts against…

00:31:00.317 --> 00:31:02.486
the nation's interests a spy.

00:31:03.361 --> 00:31:06.698
This war needs to happen
for the good of all our citizens.

00:31:08.992 --> 00:31:10.619
Seo Munju's in the way.

00:31:17.334 --> 00:31:21.838
First, I believed it was the US
that wanted her dead.

00:31:24.382 --> 00:31:28.220
Then I thought maybe it was North Korea
who hired me to put her in danger.

00:31:33.683 --> 00:31:35.560
But this isn't really that kind of game.

00:31:36.061 --> 00:31:37.687
It doesn't matter which country.

00:31:37.771 --> 00:31:40.732
There are only those who want war,

00:31:40.816 --> 00:31:42.859
those who want to stop them,

00:31:42.943 --> 00:31:46.363
and those who stand to gain from
the chaos, whether there's a war or not.

00:31:52.369 --> 00:31:55.539
The submarine was never
the real reason for the war.

00:31:57.332 --> 00:31:59.751
They needed to make it happen
for another reason.

00:32:00.919 --> 00:32:02.087
Something else.

00:32:06.466 --> 00:32:08.135
Tell me that reason

00:32:09.761 --> 00:32:11.596
and I'll get you the real spy.

00:32:25.986 --> 00:32:27.988
You think I'd reveal state secrets

00:32:28.947 --> 00:32:30.866
to a spy that I don't trust?

00:32:30.949 --> 00:32:34.327
Going after someone
who's trying to start a war

00:32:35.996 --> 00:32:37.247
for their own benefit…

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:39.916
would be far more beneficial
than taking her down.

00:32:42.752 --> 00:32:44.004
For this nation…

00:32:46.047 --> 00:32:47.382
and its people.

00:33:03.982 --> 00:33:05.275
Ma'am.

00:33:06.568 --> 00:33:08.820
Here, look at this.
It's the plan to get you out.

00:33:08.904 --> 00:33:11.323
We'll be departing from Morae Port here,
which is no longer in use,

00:33:11.406 --> 00:33:13.825
on a day with rough weather
and high waves.

00:33:15.744 --> 00:33:18.038
First, we'll take a small boat,

00:33:18.121 --> 00:33:20.832
then transfer to a foreign vessel
in international waters.

00:33:20.916 --> 00:33:22.959
We're ready to leave when you are.

00:33:23.043 --> 00:33:25.337
You need to get to Argentina
and secure that two trillion won.

00:33:29.799 --> 00:33:33.887
I'll think about it, Miji,
but it's gonna be hard right now.

00:33:41.478 --> 00:33:45.398
Is it because of Mr. Paik Sanho?

00:33:48.276 --> 00:33:49.611
What are you talking about?

00:33:50.403 --> 00:33:52.239
I still have a lot to do here, Miji.

00:33:52.322 --> 00:33:54.699
Speaking of which,
why hasn't he called yet?

00:33:55.283 --> 00:33:56.493
I told him not to.

00:33:57.244 --> 00:33:59.079
But still, how could he not call?

00:33:59.746 --> 00:34:00.956
I mean, you're…

00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:05.210
You're going through…
You know, a really difficult time.

00:34:09.506 --> 00:34:10.757
Right.

00:34:11.424 --> 00:34:13.385
Mr. Im Dujin has been released.

00:34:13.468 --> 00:34:16.680
He called asking about you.

00:34:16.763 --> 00:34:18.598
I told him I didn't know anything.

00:34:28.608 --> 00:34:29.693
Who is it?

00:34:35.365 --> 00:34:36.449
Hello.

00:34:38.493 --> 00:34:39.661
THE FATE OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA

00:34:42.747 --> 00:34:45.875
- Sorry you had to go through that.
- No, it wasn't bad.

00:34:45.959 --> 00:34:47.919
They don't torture people these days,

00:34:48.003 --> 00:34:50.255
and if they don't get a warrant
within 48 hours,

00:34:50.338 --> 00:34:52.882
they release you immediately.

00:34:54.509 --> 00:34:55.593
So…

00:34:56.636 --> 00:34:57.846
how have you been?

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:03.560
Sir, I'm planning to leave Korea.

00:35:04.811 --> 00:35:06.438
Leave Korea?

00:35:06.521 --> 00:35:07.647
And go where?

00:35:09.482 --> 00:35:13.028
- Didn't they put you on a no-fly list?
- I'll stow away on a ship.

00:35:13.111 --> 00:35:14.321
A ship?

00:35:14.404 --> 00:35:15.905
I'm leaving tonight.

00:35:16.489 --> 00:35:19.409
Wait, from where?

00:35:20.577 --> 00:35:22.370
Do you want to come with me?

00:35:22.454 --> 00:35:24.372
You were planning to leave too.

00:35:25.123 --> 00:35:30.211
Well, I think I'm too old for that now.

00:35:33.173 --> 00:35:34.674
So if you leave,

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:36.968
I'll never see you again?

00:35:48.772 --> 00:35:50.774
Mr. Im, can I take this?

00:35:50.857 --> 00:35:52.817
Of course you can.

00:35:52.901 --> 00:35:53.943
BY IM DUJIN

00:35:57.072 --> 00:35:58.323
Will you sign it for me?

00:35:58.823 --> 00:36:00.659
Yeah, I'll get the pen.

00:36:21.971 --> 00:36:23.848
You're gonna come with me, sir.

00:36:23.932 --> 00:36:27.185
You said you were going to
your relative's farm in Argentina, anyway.

00:36:32.691 --> 00:36:36.403
I really don't understand.
Why are you doing this?

00:36:36.486 --> 00:36:38.822
Have you completely lost your mind?

00:36:41.157 --> 00:36:44.035
There must be some kind
of misunderstanding. Just look at me.

00:36:44.619 --> 00:36:45.995
You know me!

00:36:46.079 --> 00:36:48.039
Tell me why you are doing this!

00:36:59.843 --> 00:37:02.137
Tell me what you want from me.

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:05.390
What do you want, Munju?
What do you want me to do?

00:37:09.519 --> 00:37:11.187
Why didn't I realize it sooner?

00:37:11.855 --> 00:37:14.774
The first person Junik showed
Anderson's letter to.

00:37:15.775 --> 00:37:17.694
After receiving that letter,

00:37:17.777 --> 00:37:20.822
I prayed to the Lord all night.

00:37:20.905 --> 00:37:22.991
The one who knew
Father Yang had that letter.

00:37:26.786 --> 00:37:27.954
MILITARY
TOP SECRET

00:37:28.037 --> 00:37:29.539
COMPREHENSIVE WAR
PREPAREDNESS PLAN

00:37:29.622 --> 00:37:33.168
A person who had access to
all the NIS's classified information.

00:37:33.251 --> 00:37:36.171
The kind of person
who carefully picks the right paper

00:37:36.254 --> 00:37:37.547
even for a single business card.

00:37:46.014 --> 00:37:47.015
And…

00:37:48.641 --> 00:37:52.020
the only person
I ever opened up to about my pain.

00:38:03.323 --> 00:38:06.326
The number you have dialed
is not in service or cannot be completed…

00:38:31.768 --> 00:38:33.311
Did you kill my husband?

00:38:36.272 --> 00:38:38.024
Did you kill Father Yang Inbo?

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:42.946
Are you a spy for North Korea?

00:38:45.949 --> 00:38:48.451
I'm an undercover NIS secretary,

00:38:48.535 --> 00:38:49.536
a spy hunter.

00:38:49.619 --> 00:38:52.205
The agency's name may have changed,

00:38:52.288 --> 00:38:55.792
and many directors have come and gone,

00:38:55.875 --> 00:38:57.794
but my job's always the same.

00:38:57.877 --> 00:39:00.630
Finding spies among left-wing activists.

00:39:00.713 --> 00:39:03.299
And your husband was going to be

00:39:03.383 --> 00:39:08.763
the best product of all the spies
I ever created

00:39:08.847 --> 00:39:11.349
in the last 50 years.

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:13.184
It can't be.

00:39:13.268 --> 00:39:17.146
We'd been searching for proof
that Jang Junik was a spy for a long time.

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:19.607
All of his call records,
financial transactions!

00:39:19.691 --> 00:39:20.733
I don't believe you.

00:39:20.817 --> 00:39:22.902
I obtained proof from

00:39:24.112 --> 00:39:25.655
a reliable source.

00:39:26.239 --> 00:39:27.824
Prosecutor Jang Junsang!

00:39:27.907 --> 00:39:28.992
Stop lying!

00:39:38.334 --> 00:39:40.128
This phone is turned off.

00:39:40.211 --> 00:39:43.214
You will be directed to voicemail
and charged after the to--

00:39:44.799 --> 00:39:48.344
When your husband brought me
the letter, I knew.

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:51.556
That it was going to be
a historic turning point.

00:39:51.639 --> 00:39:56.561
When people found out that the New
Republican Party's candidate was a spy,

00:39:57.145 --> 00:40:01.065
the complacent and distorted illusion
of peaceful reunification

00:40:01.149 --> 00:40:02.984
was going to shatter,

00:40:03.067 --> 00:40:05.403
and our people were finally
going to see the right path.

00:40:05.486 --> 00:40:06.905
You're insane.

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:13.244
I had the ultimate weapon
to turn Jang Junik into a spy.

00:40:13.828 --> 00:40:15.163
And you know what?

00:40:15.246 --> 00:40:16.247
It was you.

00:40:17.707 --> 00:40:18.708
What?

00:40:18.791 --> 00:40:20.793
Your father, Seo Hyeongsik!

00:40:23.838 --> 00:40:28.468
In 1983, he was arrested in the spy case
involving Korean miners in Germany.

00:40:28.551 --> 00:40:31.638
He was tortured
and died in prison from his injuries.

00:40:33.473 --> 00:40:34.474
That can't be true.

00:40:34.557 --> 00:40:35.767
Do you get it now?

00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:39.312
You see why your mother had
to flee to America with you

00:40:39.395 --> 00:40:42.565
and why she told you
never to go back to Korea?

00:40:44.317 --> 00:40:48.112
When you got married,
your mother-in-law came to see me.

00:40:49.322 --> 00:40:52.158
And asked me to erase all records
of your father's spying.

00:40:52.742 --> 00:40:54.577
I told her it was my expertise,

00:40:54.661 --> 00:40:58.957
knowing I could bring them back
anytime I wanted.

00:41:00.458 --> 00:41:04.963
You can imagine what was supposed
to happen tonight, can't you?

00:41:05.046 --> 00:41:08.925
You were going to be arrested by the NIS
at Geumseol Port while fleeing.

00:41:09.759 --> 00:41:11.052
Tomorrow,

00:41:11.135 --> 00:41:13.846
the whole country
would be talking about you.

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:17.350
A spy's daughter who came back for revenge

00:41:17.433 --> 00:41:21.646
and tried to become the president
to overthrow the South Korean government!

00:41:23.272 --> 00:41:26.651
Then everyone would finally realize
who our true enemy is

00:41:26.734 --> 00:41:28.736
and why this war must happen!

00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:31.906
That's the South Korea
that I want to create!

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:33.825
That is my dream!

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:39.664
So this is how the NIS
would frame people as spies?

00:41:39.747 --> 00:41:41.708
By spreading lies,

00:41:41.791 --> 00:41:44.752
and turning them into whatever you want,
regardless of the truth.

00:41:46.045 --> 00:41:51.634
This is how people become spies and end up
killed, or crippled, or exiled from Korea.

00:41:53.386 --> 00:41:56.055
And you say you're doing this
for the good of the country.

00:41:56.597 --> 00:42:00.601
Your father was the type of person
I hate the most.

00:42:01.185 --> 00:42:04.397
Even when his limbs were
being ripped apart under torture,

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:06.399
he never gave up a single name.

00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:10.862
And do you know how I know that?

00:42:11.654 --> 00:42:15.742
Because I was the one who turned him in!

00:42:32.925 --> 00:42:34.594
Tell the person behind the curtain

00:42:34.677 --> 00:42:37.680
that Seo Munju won't be going
to Geumseol Port tonight.

00:42:39.932 --> 00:42:41.309
She's leaving from Morae Port.

00:42:51.527 --> 00:42:56.532
Seo Munju won't be going
to Geumseol Port tonight.

00:42:57.492 --> 00:42:59.786
She's leaving from Morae Port.

00:43:20.765 --> 00:43:22.850
What were you doing at Geumseol Port?

00:43:22.934 --> 00:43:24.185
What's your plan?

00:43:25.436 --> 00:43:26.979
Did someone call you there?

00:43:29.524 --> 00:43:31.150
If they did, it's a trap.

00:43:50.086 --> 00:43:51.838
MORAE PORT

00:43:58.469 --> 00:43:59.971
Don't meet them where they want.

00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:02.932
Don't do anything on their terms, Munju.

00:44:03.724 --> 00:44:05.393
Go meet them on your own terms.

00:44:50.771 --> 00:44:51.981
It's you.

00:44:52.064 --> 00:44:53.399
Hi, Eunseong.

00:44:54.692 --> 00:44:56.360
My mom's not here.

00:44:56.444 --> 00:44:57.862
Yeah, I know.

00:44:59.113 --> 00:45:02.241
Then who are you here to see?

00:45:03.701 --> 00:45:04.785
You, Eunseong.

00:45:41.656 --> 00:45:43.491
I must say, I'm impressed.

00:45:44.158 --> 00:45:46.494
Coming here was never a part of my plan.

00:45:51.332 --> 00:45:52.792
Let me go first.

00:45:52.875 --> 00:45:54.460
I did what you wanted!

00:46:00.466 --> 00:46:02.635
Hanna is a highly trained marksman.

00:46:02.718 --> 00:46:05.137
The second you even twitch your finger,

00:46:05.221 --> 00:46:07.640
she'll put a bullet right
through your head…

00:46:16.148 --> 00:46:17.984
to finally get her revenge.

00:46:24.949 --> 00:46:28.160
My plan is to get a confession out of her.

00:46:28.244 --> 00:46:31.080
I know it'll be difficult,
but don't do anything until then.

00:46:33.457 --> 00:46:35.543
The day I went to meet you
for the first time,

00:46:37.253 --> 00:46:38.587
Junik said this to me.

00:46:39.088 --> 00:46:41.716
My mother might seem a bit intimidating,

00:46:42.258 --> 00:46:43.884
but she's actually a good person.

00:46:45.594 --> 00:46:47.263
I'm sure you'll get along great.

00:46:47.346 --> 00:46:48.556
Mother,

00:46:50.224 --> 00:46:51.684
did you kill Junik?

00:46:56.897 --> 00:46:58.232
Wasn't me.

00:47:02.028 --> 00:47:03.362
Do you remember?

00:47:04.655 --> 00:47:06.073
Every Parents' Day,

00:47:07.658 --> 00:47:10.328
Junik would bring you a bouquet
of beautiful peonies…

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:15.333
saying they were your favorite flowers.

00:47:19.837 --> 00:47:21.589
Did you kill your son?

00:47:25.259 --> 00:47:26.510
I did not.

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:34.643
Junik and I never had anything
to argue about, except you.

00:47:34.727 --> 00:47:37.980
He couldn't bear hearing
even the slightest criticism of you.

00:47:38.064 --> 00:47:41.025
Can't you be more understanding?
She's my mother.

00:47:44.945 --> 00:47:46.155
Mother.

00:47:48.908 --> 00:47:50.368
Did you kill your son?

00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:58.793
Junik…

00:48:01.045 --> 00:48:03.214
was a child from my husband's affair.

00:48:08.719 --> 00:48:13.224
The first time I held him in my arms,
I made up my mind.

00:48:15.267 --> 00:48:18.687
"If I can't raise him as my own,
I'm finished."

00:48:21.565 --> 00:48:23.484
Junik changed, and it's your fault, Munju!

00:48:23.567 --> 00:48:25.027
It's because of you.

00:48:26.612 --> 00:48:28.239
He died because of you.

00:48:34.203 --> 00:48:35.371
Go ahead, Hanna.

00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:55.641
Shoot!

00:48:58.978 --> 00:49:00.229
Who are you?

00:49:04.442 --> 00:49:07.361
Is your name Stella Young?

00:49:08.904 --> 00:49:11.157
Who's the real Stella Young?

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:12.950
Stella Young…

00:49:14.743 --> 00:49:16.579
is the woman who built the submarine.

00:49:17.246 --> 00:49:19.999
Open the drawer with no name.

00:49:52.656 --> 00:49:53.908
Ms. Seo.

00:50:00.998 --> 00:50:05.419
I've been waiting for this moment
to finally avenge Junik.

00:50:07.546 --> 00:50:09.798
I know you're the one who killed him.

00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:24.480
Hands up! Don't move!

00:50:25.523 --> 00:50:28.651
Drop your weapons! Drop your weapons!
Don't move! Hands up!

00:50:36.158 --> 00:50:39.078
Shoot any armed spy, whoever it is.

00:50:55.719 --> 00:50:56.720
Come on, shoot them!

00:51:08.107 --> 00:51:10.317
Get up!

00:51:27.126 --> 00:51:28.836
Whatever happens, find Seo Munju first.

00:51:30.296 --> 00:51:31.422
Unit 2, block the exit!

00:51:31.505 --> 00:51:33.257
If you hear anything, just shoot.

00:51:51.525 --> 00:51:53.444
How can I ever trust you?

00:51:55.529 --> 00:51:56.697
Don't trust me.

00:51:58.657 --> 00:52:00.409
Just know I'll be right behind you.

00:52:02.745 --> 00:52:03.746
Always.

00:52:18.677 --> 00:52:20.638
Captain! Captain!

00:52:20.721 --> 00:52:22.056
They jumped!

00:52:36.362 --> 00:52:37.613
I had a dream.

00:52:42.618 --> 00:52:44.662
There was something in the water.

00:52:50.125 --> 00:52:52.878
I wished I could get close enough
to see it clearly.

00:53:00.636 --> 00:53:02.304
Who killed my husband?

00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:08.519
Why did my mother have to
live her entire life in pain?

00:53:14.983 --> 00:53:17.403
Why can't I let go of the child I lost,

00:53:18.070 --> 00:53:20.989
and why does my heart still yearn
for that man?

00:53:42.511 --> 00:53:45.514
It felt like seeing it
could answer all these questions.

00:53:52.271 --> 00:53:54.356
If only I could get
close enough to see it…

00:54:00.487 --> 00:54:03.907
I thought I'd finally have
the answers to all my questions.
