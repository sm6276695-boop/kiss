WEBVTT

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:05.630
Leo!

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:08.299
Leo!

00:00:08.883 --> 00:00:10.969
Leo!

00:00:11.553 --> 00:00:13.680
Leo!

00:00:25.108 --> 00:00:27.527
You didn't do it. Listen to me.

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:30.989
The one who killed him was me.

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:32.490
Okay?

00:00:46.337 --> 00:00:47.297
What time is it?

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:49.466
Three o'clock.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.179
It's okay now. You can go home.

00:00:55.013 --> 00:00:57.557
I don't have to go to school anyway,
so it's fine.

00:00:58.141 --> 00:00:59.976
Staying here won't change anything.

00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:03.646
Once they do all the tests,

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.609
and they don't find any issues,
I can go home tomorrow.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.528
When did you hear that?

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.199
Just a second ago.

00:01:14.282 --> 00:01:15.658
Oh really?

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:17.827
Are you sure you're okay?

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.746
You have a point.

00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:22.082
I might be going crazy.

00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:29.964
I'm sorry for causing a fire.

00:01:36.137 --> 00:01:38.348
Ko Suzuki isn't the culprit?

00:01:39.057 --> 00:01:41.267
He fully admits that he did it.

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:46.773
However…
We believed that the candlestick found in

00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:50.527
the victim's painting
was the weapon that was used,

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.989
but the shape of the weapon that
Ko Suzuki drew…

00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:56.699
didn't match it.

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:59.911
Ko Suzuki is hiding something.

00:01:59.994 --> 00:02:02.664
There was probably
just another candlestick there.

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:07.585
What you need to do right now,

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:11.089
is solidify evidence
proving that Ko Suzuki is the culprit

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:13.758
and have prosecution indict him already.

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:16.219
Make sure this reinvestigation succeeds.

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:19.139
Yes.

00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:25.645
Leaving an iron unattended
can lead to a massive fire.

00:02:25.728 --> 00:02:27.564
So please be careful in the future.

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:30.150
I'm sorry for the trouble.
Thank you very much.

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:31.484
Well then, goodbye.

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.492
I'm glad it was just a little fire.
But I'm so puzzled.

00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:41.244
What's puzzling?

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:44.914
Ever since Leo was small,
he never made mistakes.

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:49.878
We used to be worried about how
meticulous and orderly he is.

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.341
He's not the type to leave the iron on
and go to sleep.

00:02:57.594 --> 00:02:59.762
He's probably shaken up about his uncle.

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:06.811
Is Nella back?

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:09.439
- Yes. I'll go back too then.
- Okay.

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:14.861
You were a lifesaver again, today.

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:29.375
Welcome back.

00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:32.962
I'm glad there was nothing wrong with Leo.

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:34.881
So it was the iron after all, huh?

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:38.551
The firefighter said there were no signs
of a fault current.

00:03:40.803 --> 00:03:43.973
It's almost morning,
but should we go back to bed?

00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:53.149
Did something happen at the hospital?

00:03:54.108 --> 00:03:55.777
I don't think Ko

00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:58.821
killed Fuse after all.

00:04:01.157 --> 00:04:04.202
When I saw Leo lying down in the smoke,

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.831
I got another flashback from that time.

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:12.168
When I woke up,

00:04:13.127 --> 00:04:14.545
I saw a man's feet…

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.341
You didn't do it.

00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:22.720
Listen to me.
The one who killed him was me.

00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:26.099
That was Ko's voice.
There's no doubt about it.

00:04:26.182 --> 00:04:27.517
Wait a second.

00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:31.479
The other day,
you said that you saw a man's feet

00:04:31.562 --> 00:04:33.815
when you regained consciousness, right?

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:38.736
So this time, you remembered the voice
you heard during that time?

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:39.737
Right.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.241
He said, "You didn't do it."

00:04:43.866 --> 00:04:45.451
Who did he say that to?

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:48.705
- Me.
- Huh?

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:52.834
I think Ko took the blame for me.

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:56.629
So, in the end,

00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:00.758
I think I was the one who killed Fuse.

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:07.640
I'll go tell the police now.

00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:09.726
Hey, hey, wait!

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:15.690
Tell me what happened, in more detail.

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:17.567
More details?

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:20.945
More details…

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:25.241
That day,

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:28.745
Fuse and I got into a heated fight,

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.455
and I hit my head

00:05:32.081 --> 00:05:33.666
and lost my memory.

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:36.544
That's what I thought.

00:05:38.254 --> 00:05:40.757
But maybe I killed Fuse after all,

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:45.094
and I just don't remember what happened.

00:05:45.678 --> 00:05:48.806
The police aren't going to
take you seriously if it's just a "maybe."

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.018
But if Ko was protecting somebody

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:54.395
in that moment and that situation,

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.606
it could only be me.

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:59.442
Even if that's true,
it won't be that easy.

00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:01.486
- Why?
- Calm down.

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:03.780
As I've said before,

00:06:04.655 --> 00:06:06.657
your memory alone is not evidence,

00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:09.327
and your uncle will not be
released right away.

00:06:10.995 --> 00:06:13.664
But Ko isn't the one who did it.

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:17.376
No matter how you look at it,

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.505
it was me.

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:43.736
What Nella is saying is probably right.

00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:46.697
Nella killed Fuse

00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:50.660
and her uncle saw it
and took the blame for her.

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:56.791
If you think about it that way,
the fact that he kept quiet for 15 years

00:06:57.458 --> 00:07:01.504
and turned himself in at this moment,
all makes sense.

00:07:06.634 --> 00:07:09.053
If you really did kill someone,

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:13.474
what am I supposed to do,

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.645
as a lawyer

00:07:20.898 --> 00:07:22.108
and as your husband?

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:40.501
I heard there was a fire yesterday.

00:07:41.085 --> 00:07:42.587
News travels fast, doesn't it?

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:50.386
You haven't been to the office in a while?

00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:54.724
The reporters aren't here anymore,
so I can come in every day now,

00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:57.393
but all of my big jobs were canceled.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.520
What is wrong

00:07:59.604 --> 00:08:02.815
with this world and its cancel culture?

00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:10.656
That detective is handsome.

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:13.784
It's my first time meeting someone
better looking than you.

00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:15.953
I'm not competing with anyone
with my looks.

00:08:17.788 --> 00:08:19.457
- Right…
- Yes.

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:23.628
How is Ko Suzuki doing?

00:08:23.711 --> 00:08:27.381
He answers all of our questions
without reservation.

00:08:27.465 --> 00:08:29.091
To the point that it's unnatural.

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:30.718
Are you saying

00:08:30.801 --> 00:08:35.264
that you think that
Ko Suzuki is not the real culprit?

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:39.101
The moment we reopened the case,
your wife regained her memories,

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:43.523
Ko Suzuki turned himself in,
and there was a fire.

00:08:44.565 --> 00:08:45.900
It's all too timely.

00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:50.029
This string of events
doesn't sit well with me.

00:08:50.112 --> 00:08:52.573
Coming to see me
isn't going to solve anything, though.

00:08:52.657 --> 00:08:54.742
You won't get anything
out of shaking me up.

00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:58.454
Even if Ko Suzuki confesses to everything,

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:02.041
without conclusive evidence,
the prosecution can't indict him.

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:05.086
If you can't indict him
after reopening a case that

00:09:05.169 --> 00:09:06.837
the police already misjudged once,

00:09:07.421 --> 00:09:09.215
the police will completely lose face.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.428
The superintendent general campaign
won't go as you planned.

00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:15.930
Is something irritating you?

00:09:16.013 --> 00:09:18.224
How am I not supposed to be
irritated right now?

00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:20.977
I'm glad I came.

00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:26.566
You can be really annoying, you know?

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:27.984
Is that right?

00:09:28.067 --> 00:09:29.819
I'll try to be careful next time.

00:09:30.486 --> 00:09:31.779
Thank you for your time.

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:34.865
I was able to learn a lot.

00:09:52.008 --> 00:09:53.342
Welcome home.

00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:00.766
I'm glad you're okay.

00:10:01.976 --> 00:10:02.852
Want barley tea?

00:10:02.935 --> 00:10:05.271
- It's okay. I'll get it myself.
- Yeah?

00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:08.399
I'm sorry, Dad.

00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:10.651
No need to apologize.

00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:12.820
It definitely could have been worse.

00:10:13.738 --> 00:10:15.239
I'll go clean up the first floor.

00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:17.033
- I'll help.
- It's okay.

00:10:17.783 --> 00:10:20.953
Stay here until you're done
cleaning up downstairs.

00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:23.456
I've kept your room here the way it was.

00:10:31.547 --> 00:10:33.257
It's so messy.

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:35.217
You should be a little more organized.

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:37.386
It's hard, considering his job.

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:42.683
Everything smells like smoke.
All the fabric is ruined.

00:10:43.267 --> 00:10:44.769
Let's clean this up for now.

00:10:49.231 --> 00:10:50.858
You didn't do it.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.030
The one who killed him was me.

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:02.328
What's wrong?

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:08.709
You didn't get any sleep last night.
Go to the second floor and rest.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:10.878
Yeah, I'll do that.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.100
- Dad.
- Huh?

00:11:24.183 --> 00:11:27.186
You didn't rummage through this room
after I went to the hospital, right?

00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:29.063
What do you mean, "rummage"?

00:11:29.146 --> 00:11:32.817
What am I supposed to rummage through
when all you've got is idol costumes?

00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:00.719
- Can I go home now?
- Yeah.

00:12:01.762 --> 00:12:05.099
Are those the ones Tomobe
from the National Police Agency sent?

00:12:05.182 --> 00:12:06.434
Yeah.

00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:09.770
You're still looking into it?

00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:15.609
Don't tell me…
Do the police suspect your wife again?

00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:19.405
That's why the detective came?

00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:22.158
I don't know what
the detective came here for.

00:12:22.741 --> 00:12:24.827
The killer wasn't the uncle

00:12:25.369 --> 00:12:27.913
but your wife, after all?

00:12:29.081 --> 00:12:32.793
If I put my all into investigating
this case right now,

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:36.380
I might find that my wife is the killer.

00:12:36.464 --> 00:12:38.674
That's why I told you to get divorced!

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.969
- You'll really lose everything this time.
- I know!

00:12:43.554 --> 00:12:46.765
But I want to find out the truth
with my own hands.

00:12:48.726 --> 00:12:50.478
I can't stand feeling so unsure.

00:12:50.561 --> 00:12:53.105
You're a lawyer
and not a prosecutor anymore.

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:54.857
Stop acting like a prosecutor!

00:12:56.066 --> 00:12:59.570
And get away from that family.

00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:05.951
Jeez!

00:13:12.249 --> 00:13:15.127
This is going to be the end
for Harada Kotaro Law Office.

00:13:16.045 --> 00:13:18.172
I'd better look for another job.

00:13:18.756 --> 00:13:19.590
Sorry.

00:13:23.677 --> 00:13:25.763
If you need anything, I'll help.

00:14:19.817 --> 00:14:21.360
Sorry for making you come out here.

00:14:21.443 --> 00:14:22.570
What happened?

00:14:23.779 --> 00:14:27.741
I wanted to talk outside, since being
in the house feels a little suffocating.

00:14:33.622 --> 00:14:35.332
What a beautiful sunset.

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.588
About yesterday…

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:48.178
Up until now, I've done what I could
to look into the case and get information.

00:14:48.804 --> 00:14:52.308
But I was scared of
finding out the real killer,

00:14:53.017 --> 00:14:55.811
so I held back from
diving into the truth myself.

00:14:58.188 --> 00:15:00.608
But I'm changing that mindset from today.

00:15:03.277 --> 00:15:07.406
I want to find the truth myself,
without waiting for the police.

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:14.496
I knew you’d say that,
since you're a lawyer.

00:15:17.416 --> 00:15:22.004
But when you find the truth,
that will be the end for us.

00:15:23.255 --> 00:15:24.089
Why?

00:15:24.965 --> 00:15:28.677
Because I'm the one who did it.

00:15:41.607 --> 00:15:45.319
Even if you are the one who did it,
I will accept that fact.

00:15:51.241 --> 00:15:52.993
I will love you, no matter who you are.

00:15:59.375 --> 00:16:02.503
Kotaro, your life will be ruined.

00:16:02.586 --> 00:16:06.423
I won't let anything ruin my life,
or your life either.

00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:13.222
Aren't I amazing?

00:16:18.143 --> 00:16:19.561
You're amazing!

00:16:21.522 --> 00:16:23.565
You're really amazing.

00:16:43.043 --> 00:16:45.045
You're bigger than me, huh?

00:16:47.715 --> 00:16:50.300
I've always thought the same thing.

00:16:59.143 --> 00:17:02.646
Do you have any intention
of dropping the reinvestigation?

00:17:03.522 --> 00:17:04.440
I do not.

00:17:04.523 --> 00:17:06.150
You're at a standstill, right?

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:09.945
The statements of the person you arrested,
Ko Suzuki, are faulty,

00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:12.573
and you haven't found new evidence,
I've heard.

00:17:12.656 --> 00:17:15.367
At this rate, you can't indict him.

00:17:19.038 --> 00:17:22.082
The fact that you even tried to
overturn a case

00:17:22.166 --> 00:17:26.211
that the police already deemed
an accident was out of line.

00:17:27.629 --> 00:17:28.922
Just give up.

00:17:30.466 --> 00:17:32.593
Even Criminal Investigation Director Sasao

00:17:32.676 --> 00:17:35.804
is just using you to
boost his chances of getting promoted.

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:38.057
I already know the real killer.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.017
Stop talking nonsense.

00:17:42.519 --> 00:17:45.564
I won't let you get in my way again,
Security Director.

00:17:47.816 --> 00:17:50.652
Beware of becoming a lapdog
for the criminal investigation director.

00:17:51.528 --> 00:17:54.698
There's a chance that I will become
the superintendent general.

00:17:57.493 --> 00:17:58.619
If you'll excuse me…

00:18:07.544 --> 00:18:08.670
{\an8}Please accept this.

00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:12.257
{\an8}Oh, how unfortunate…

00:18:12.341 --> 00:18:14.551
But I'll hold onto this.

00:18:16.428 --> 00:18:19.306
Ms. Suzuki, do your best.

00:18:19.389 --> 00:18:21.100
Thank you for everything.

00:18:27.731 --> 00:18:29.024
Nell-nell!

00:18:31.318 --> 00:18:32.903
You're quitting?

00:18:33.695 --> 00:18:37.491
You were so much better
than our new teacher.

00:18:37.574 --> 00:18:40.869
Our new teacher looks like she's wearing
a bowl on her head and it's creepy.

00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:44.081
Wearing a bowl on her head?
That's very nice.

00:18:44.748 --> 00:18:45.791
Take care.

00:18:48.168 --> 00:18:50.546
- You think it's nice?
- I don't know.

00:18:51.255 --> 00:18:53.590
MEIHO MEDICAL UNIVERSITY

00:18:59.638 --> 00:19:00.681
PROFESSOR'S OFFICE

00:19:00.764 --> 00:19:02.266
Yes? Come in!

00:19:03.642 --> 00:19:04.601
Hello. Excuse me.

00:19:04.685 --> 00:19:08.272
Oh! Long time no see!

00:19:08.856 --> 00:19:10.566
I brought your favorite mizu yokan.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.986
You know me so well. Thanks, Harada.

00:19:14.069 --> 00:19:16.697
I'm glad to see you're doing well.

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:19.116
But this place still gives me goosebumps.

00:19:19.199 --> 00:19:21.201
I just had them purify this place
last month.

00:19:21.285 --> 00:19:22.244
Last month?

00:19:22.327 --> 00:19:23.203
Will you eat with me?

00:19:23.287 --> 00:19:25.038
I'm fine.

00:19:27.124 --> 00:19:32.212
Remember how I asked for a second opinion
from the perspective of forensic medicine?

00:19:32.796 --> 00:19:33.797
- Oh, that.
- Yes.

00:19:34.548 --> 00:19:38.051
I looked at the files for that case,
but it's tricky.

00:19:39.553 --> 00:19:41.471
We don't even have the body anymore.

00:19:41.555 --> 00:19:42.764
I see…

00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:46.185
But quite a few things
caught my attention.

00:19:46.268 --> 00:19:47.352
What?

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:52.316
The two depressed skull fractures
on the victim's head were,

00:19:52.399 --> 00:19:54.610
just as the police concluded,

00:19:55.235 --> 00:19:58.071
not likely to have been a result
of falling from the stairs.

00:19:59.156 --> 00:20:03.202
But, putting that aside,
there is something else that stands out.

00:20:03.285 --> 00:20:04.244
What is it?

00:20:05.829 --> 00:20:07.122
These two…

00:20:07.623 --> 00:20:11.251
It's hard to see,
but the shape of the wounds are different.

00:20:12.377 --> 00:20:16.381
This one has a vertical
and horizontal line. Look closely.

00:20:17.841 --> 00:20:18.884
You're right.

00:20:18.967 --> 00:20:20.469
The other one doesn't.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.262
What?

00:20:22.846 --> 00:20:24.348
So they are different weapons?

00:20:24.431 --> 00:20:29.186
Or it's the same weapon
but it was used differently.

00:20:33.774 --> 00:20:35.359
Hitting like this

00:20:36.276 --> 00:20:39.696
and hitting like this result in
different areas contacting the victim.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.740
That's true.

00:20:41.823 --> 00:20:43.992
If you hit differently,
the wounds will look different.

00:20:44.076 --> 00:20:47.412
I don't know why, but he may have
changed the way he held the weapon.

00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:52.960
No, but he said he frantically hit him
in order to save his niece.

00:20:53.043 --> 00:20:55.754
Would he really reposition the weapon
in that situation?

00:20:57.714 --> 00:20:58.757
- True.
- Yeah…

00:21:00.342 --> 00:21:01.635
- What?
- Huh?

00:21:03.887 --> 00:21:05.847
It might be more than one killer.

00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:07.307
What?

00:21:10.435 --> 00:21:14.022
- I'm Harada. Nice to meet you.
- I'm Kazuo Hayashi.

00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:16.358
- Please have a seat.
- Thank you.

00:21:16.942 --> 00:21:18.277
Who is that?

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.695
A public defender.

00:21:19.778 --> 00:21:22.030
He's meeting
his relative's public defender?

00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:23.490
Seems like it.

00:21:23.573 --> 00:21:26.660
He's a young lawyer, so maybe he came
out of respect for his senior?

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:30.956
He is saying
that the weapon was a candlestick.

00:21:31.039 --> 00:21:34.543
Candlestick? A metal one?

00:21:34.626 --> 00:21:35.502
Yes.

00:21:35.585 --> 00:21:37.045
Was it long?

00:21:37.796 --> 00:21:40.465
He said they made him
draw it during questioning.

00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:45.554
To me, he explained it as
one single, long candlestick.

00:21:45.637 --> 00:21:48.056
It was at Fuse's atelier,

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.560
and he grabbed it without thinking
and frantically hit him.

00:21:51.643 --> 00:21:52.477
Frantically…

00:21:53.478 --> 00:21:55.272
It hasn't been found yet, right?

00:21:55.355 --> 00:21:57.941
They searched the river,
but couldn't find it.

00:21:58.025 --> 00:22:00.068
It's been 15 years, after all.

00:22:00.152 --> 00:22:02.738
Ko Suzuki said that
he threw it in the river?

00:22:02.821 --> 00:22:03.655
That's right.

00:22:03.739 --> 00:22:06.074
Do you think
he really threw it in the river?

00:22:07.951 --> 00:22:10.912
He turned himself in
and confessed to the crime,

00:22:10.996 --> 00:22:13.957
so I don't see any reason why
he would have to lie.

00:22:14.583 --> 00:22:15.625
Right.

00:22:17.377 --> 00:22:22.758
Almost all of the candlesticks in Japan
are made to be used on Buddhist altars.

00:22:22.841 --> 00:22:23.759
TOKUICHI METALS

00:22:23.842 --> 00:22:27.262
But when it comes to Western style
candlesticks, Tokuichi Metals

00:22:27.345 --> 00:22:28.430
has the largest domestic market share.

00:22:28.513 --> 00:22:29.389
TOKUICHI METALS FACTORY

00:22:29.473 --> 00:22:33.894
We specialize in metalworking
and creating molds for metal parts.

00:22:35.062 --> 00:22:38.315
But since I'm a Christian,

00:22:38.398 --> 00:22:41.943
churches from all over the country
order candlesticks from us.

00:22:42.027 --> 00:22:44.738
Sometimes we get orders
from prop makers too.

00:22:44.821 --> 00:22:47.115
There are so many kinds.

00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:49.034
What type are you looking for?

00:22:51.661 --> 00:22:54.831
I'll be working over there,
so take your time and look around.

00:22:54.915 --> 00:22:56.083
Thank you.

00:23:07.969 --> 00:23:09.346
President!

00:23:09.429 --> 00:23:10.722
Yes?

00:23:10.806 --> 00:23:15.519
Um, do you still have products
that you made 15 years ago?

00:23:16.353 --> 00:23:17.312
Here it is.

00:23:17.813 --> 00:23:20.732
Fifteen years ago,
we were only making this design.

00:23:22.234 --> 00:23:25.529
You can fold this one, like this.

00:23:30.242 --> 00:23:31.451
Just as you suspected,

00:23:32.035 --> 00:23:35.080
{\an8}this logo matches the wound.

00:23:35.956 --> 00:23:37.874
So the first time he hit like this,

00:23:37.958 --> 00:23:39.960
and the second time he went like this?

00:23:40.043 --> 00:23:41.628
The second one might be another weapon.

00:23:41.711 --> 00:23:46.049
No, the suspect is saying that
he hit him with a candlestick.

00:23:46.133 --> 00:23:47.259
I don't think he's lying.

00:23:47.342 --> 00:23:48.593
I see.

00:23:49.261 --> 00:23:52.139
So the fatal wound with the "T" mark on it

00:23:53.849 --> 00:23:57.561
was made by swinging the candlestick
from the top, like this.

00:23:58.937 --> 00:24:00.522
What an interesting way to hit.

00:24:05.485 --> 00:24:06.611
No, like this.

00:24:09.531 --> 00:24:12.784
So the killer held it up with both hands?

00:24:13.326 --> 00:24:17.747
There was a reason why
the killer had to do that.

00:24:21.209 --> 00:24:22.961
It might be more than one killer.

00:24:23.545 --> 00:24:26.965
That was Ko's voice.
He said, "You didn't do it."

00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:31.052
The moment we reopened the case,
your wife regained her memories,

00:24:31.136 --> 00:24:36.725
Ko Suzuki turned himself in,
and there was a fire. It's all too timely.

00:25:06.087 --> 00:25:07.964
- What is it?
- Do you have a moment?

00:25:13.136 --> 00:25:16.431
It smells burnt doesn't it?
What did you want to talk about?

00:25:20.977 --> 00:25:22.646
The night there was a fire here,

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.857
Nella went into your bedroom to save you,

00:25:26.983 --> 00:25:28.318
and regained her memory.

00:25:30.487 --> 00:25:31.321
Memory of what?

00:25:32.614 --> 00:25:33.990
The incident 15 years ago.

00:25:36.576 --> 00:25:39.246
She has been remembering bits and pieces,

00:25:39.829 --> 00:25:41.998
and it happened again that night.

00:25:44.376 --> 00:25:49.256
When Nella fought with Fuse and fell,
she lost consciousness.

00:25:49.965 --> 00:25:54.636
But after that, she woke up once,
although she was still hazy.

00:25:55.762 --> 00:25:59.224
When she did,
she says she heard her uncle's voice.

00:25:59.766 --> 00:26:02.185
You didn't do it. Listen to me.

00:26:02.686 --> 00:26:05.647
The one who killed him was me.

00:26:06.231 --> 00:26:10.360
Apparently, he said,
"The one who killed him was me. Okay?"

00:26:12.988 --> 00:26:14.698
Nella heard that voice

00:26:16.408 --> 00:26:19.536
and assumed that
he was taking the blame for her.

00:26:20.161 --> 00:26:24.082
That's because she thought that she
and her uncle were the only ones there.

00:26:27.752 --> 00:26:28.962
But that's not true, right?

00:26:33.717 --> 00:26:38.638
On Fuse's body there were wounds
right here and right here.

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:44.769
He died from this wound. And it was
not the same as this wound here.

00:26:46.604 --> 00:26:50.358
During questioning, your uncle supposedly
said that he frantically hit him.

00:26:51.234 --> 00:26:54.946
But would he really reposition the weapon
when he's "frantically" hitting him?

00:26:56.114 --> 00:26:59.284
Also, if he was "frantically" hitting him,

00:26:59.367 --> 00:27:02.746
wouldn't he hit him over and over again?
But there are only two wounds.

00:27:02.829 --> 00:27:05.332
As a former prosecutor,
that also seems strange to me.

00:27:07.417 --> 00:27:10.920
But it will make sense
if you think about it like this…

00:27:13.423 --> 00:27:16.301
The first wound was made by raising

00:27:16.926 --> 00:27:19.429
the candlestick with both hands
and swinging down.

00:27:20.263 --> 00:27:24.726
Most likely, someone who isn't very strong
used two hands to hit him.

00:27:25.852 --> 00:27:30.565
For the second wound, your uncle hit him
from the side with the same weapon.

00:27:33.026 --> 00:27:36.404
The first blow should have
killed Fuse already,

00:27:36.488 --> 00:27:38.907
so why did your uncle
hit him the second time?

00:27:43.161 --> 00:27:45.163
He did that to not make you a murderer.

00:27:49.125 --> 00:27:52.754
Nella heard him say, "You didn't do it."

00:27:53.296 --> 00:27:56.549
"Listen to me.
The one who killed him was me. Okay?"

00:27:57.175 --> 00:27:59.302
But your uncle was speaking

00:28:01.054 --> 00:28:02.806
to you, wasn't he?

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:10.105
He hit a person who was already dead

00:28:10.188 --> 00:28:12.148
in order to convince you

00:28:12.232 --> 00:28:13.983
that you didn't kill anybody

00:28:14.484 --> 00:28:17.237
and that he was the killer, right?

00:28:20.073 --> 00:28:24.202
He raised you with so much care,
and he wanted to protect you.

00:28:26.329 --> 00:28:29.749
Even though you were only 11 years old,

00:28:30.458 --> 00:28:31.835
you understood that, didn't you?

00:28:50.019 --> 00:28:51.062
I did.

00:28:57.402 --> 00:29:00.363
I guess you weren't
a prosecutor for nothing.

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:13.334
Wait here for a second.

00:29:41.196 --> 00:29:42.030
Here.

00:29:45.366 --> 00:29:46.493
Open it up.

00:30:22.487 --> 00:30:24.906
When Nella brought Yuto Fuse over,

00:30:26.407 --> 00:30:28.618
both Dad and Ko took a liking to him.

00:30:29.828 --> 00:30:30.745
But I

00:30:32.372 --> 00:30:35.542
hated him from the first day
he came to our house.

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:39.629
I sensed that something bad
was going to happen.

00:30:41.714 --> 00:30:42.674
But…

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:46.845
Nella was so in love with him

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:48.304
that

00:30:48.972 --> 00:30:50.890
I had no choice but to give up.

00:30:52.433 --> 00:30:53.268
But

00:30:54.477 --> 00:30:58.565
soon enough,
both of them started to fall apart.

00:31:01.067 --> 00:31:01.901
That day,

00:31:03.736 --> 00:31:06.823
I felt like something bad
was going to happen to Nella.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.285
Oh, Leo?

00:31:11.786 --> 00:31:16.082
Ko, can I take these
to Mr. Fuse's atelier?

00:31:16.165 --> 00:31:19.002
Sure, you can. Put them in a bag.

00:31:22.922 --> 00:31:24.424
Hello.

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:27.302
Nella! Nella!

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:31.514
Nella…

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:33.933
Let's die together.

00:31:34.517 --> 00:31:36.853
Why do I have to die?

00:31:36.936 --> 00:31:38.313
Let's die together.

00:31:43.067 --> 00:31:45.695
NELLA IS IN A FIGHT. HELP

00:31:45.778 --> 00:31:46.946
SENDING

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:47.864
SENT

00:31:52.869 --> 00:31:57.874
I wanted to save Nella,
but my legs were shaking from fear.

00:31:59.918 --> 00:32:03.087
But on the second floor,

00:32:04.088 --> 00:32:06.633
I saw Fuse

00:32:06.716 --> 00:32:08.801
straddling Nella…

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:55.264
It's okay now.

00:32:58.267 --> 00:32:59.394
It's okay.

00:33:00.979 --> 00:33:02.063
You protected Nella, right?

00:33:10.738 --> 00:33:11.656
Close your eyes.

00:33:34.262 --> 00:33:35.304
You didn't do it.

00:33:37.598 --> 00:33:38.725
Listen to me.

00:33:40.601 --> 00:33:43.730
The one who killed him was me.

00:33:44.939 --> 00:33:46.190
Okay?

00:33:48.401 --> 00:33:50.111
Get a hold of yourself, Leo!

00:33:56.284 --> 00:33:57.910
Take this

00:33:58.578 --> 00:33:59.787
and go home.

00:34:00.788 --> 00:34:05.168
You'll pass by a river,
so throw this in there.

00:34:07.211 --> 00:34:08.421
Once you throw this away,

00:34:09.547 --> 00:34:13.134
forget about what happened today
as you walk home.

00:34:16.304 --> 00:34:17.221
Okay?

00:34:24.353 --> 00:34:25.188
Ko

00:34:26.773 --> 00:34:28.232
sent me home

00:34:29.067 --> 00:34:31.319
before dropping that man down the stairs,

00:34:31.402 --> 00:34:33.696
making it seem like it was an accident.

00:34:36.324 --> 00:34:38.993
Why didn't you throw this into the river?

00:34:39.994 --> 00:34:41.287
I don't remember.

00:34:42.455 --> 00:34:45.291
I was so scared that I rushed home.

00:34:46.125 --> 00:34:48.544
So I probably forgot to throw it away.

00:34:49.212 --> 00:34:51.506
Did your uncle know about that?

00:34:55.134 --> 00:34:55.968
He doesn't know.

00:34:57.678 --> 00:34:59.138
I couldn't tell him.

00:35:01.641 --> 00:35:02.892
Soon enough,

00:35:03.976 --> 00:35:07.897
they started suspecting Nella
and questioned her every day.

00:35:08.564 --> 00:35:09.440
And I

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:12.193
couldn't throw it away anymore.

00:35:13.486 --> 00:35:15.196
When your uncle turned himself in,

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:18.282
why didn't you try to speak up
about the truth?

00:35:22.995 --> 00:35:26.582
You thought you could carry on with life
while your uncle took the blame?

00:35:26.666 --> 00:35:28.042
I did not!

00:35:31.003 --> 00:35:31.879
But…

00:35:34.632 --> 00:35:38.219
when I heard Dad reading Ko's letter,

00:35:39.387 --> 00:35:44.392
it felt like a strict order from Ko
telling me,

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:47.895
"Don't you dare tell the truth."

00:35:53.818 --> 00:35:54.986
Ko is

00:35:57.864 --> 00:35:59.866
like a mother to me.

00:36:03.119 --> 00:36:06.956
I spent more time with him than anyone,
since the day I was born.

00:36:10.084 --> 00:36:15.756
I felt like I had to respect Ko's wishes
in my own way.

00:36:18.593 --> 00:36:21.053
You might think that I'm a coward,

00:36:24.223 --> 00:36:25.516
but it's the truth.

00:36:26.392 --> 00:36:27.351
I know

00:36:28.269 --> 00:36:31.480
very well that you are
this family's treasure.

00:36:32.815 --> 00:36:33.691
But

00:36:35.359 --> 00:36:38.321
you can't make your uncle
take the blame for murder.

00:36:43.326 --> 00:36:46.245
When you came to our house,
I felt the same kind of

00:36:47.622 --> 00:36:49.540
uneasiness as when Fuse came.

00:36:53.878 --> 00:36:56.505
I felt like you were going to
mess up our family.

00:37:02.178 --> 00:37:03.304
That's why I was

00:37:05.848 --> 00:37:06.807
always scared.

00:37:12.271 --> 00:37:13.773
And, lo and behold,

00:37:16.108 --> 00:37:17.276
you found out.

00:37:23.366 --> 00:37:25.701
I know it's scary to admit to it,

00:37:26.661 --> 00:37:27.620
but you can't

00:37:29.288 --> 00:37:31.666
let your uncle go down as a murderer.

00:37:36.837 --> 00:37:38.172
Let's go to the police together.

00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:29.223
Thank you.

00:38:33.561 --> 00:38:35.021
Now I can feel better.

00:38:41.402 --> 00:38:46.282
The law says, "An act of a person less
than 14 years of age is not punishable."

00:38:46.824 --> 00:38:49.118
So you won't be charged for it.

00:38:49.618 --> 00:38:53.831
But you will have to
come clean about the truth.

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:57.960
That is the right thing to do
as a human being.

00:39:16.062 --> 00:39:17.229
We'll be in your care.

00:39:23.402 --> 00:39:26.280
Was it the family's decision
to make him turn himself in?

00:39:26.864 --> 00:39:30.117
No, I didn't tell anyone.
He chose to come himself.

00:39:36.707 --> 00:39:37.541
This way, please.

00:39:46.425 --> 00:39:47.385
After you.

00:39:53.265 --> 00:39:54.767
Please wait here.

00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:18.499
{\an8}I'M HUNGRY, SO I'M GOING TO EAT ON MY OWN.
MISSED CALL

00:40:46.277 --> 00:40:47.111
{\an8}I'm home.

00:40:47.695 --> 00:40:50.948
{\an8}Where have you been?
I even called Mr. Usui.

00:40:51.615 --> 00:40:53.117
{\an8}Sorry I couldn't call you.

00:40:56.287 --> 00:40:58.247
{\an8}I didn't want to tell you over the phone.

00:41:08.883 --> 00:41:11.343
{\an8}I'm sorry, Dad.

00:41:14.054 --> 00:41:15.556
I'll tell you once you wake up.

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:29.361
You took him to the police?

00:41:29.945 --> 00:41:32.656
Yes. I thought that would be the best.

00:41:33.491 --> 00:41:35.951
I was with him during questioning
as his lawyer.

00:41:37.328 --> 00:41:41.373
You did what you were supposed to do
as a lawyer, huh?

00:41:44.043 --> 00:41:47.087
You stuck to your principles
as a lawyer, huh?

00:41:50.174 --> 00:41:52.426
But was that really the right choice

00:41:53.511 --> 00:41:54.887
as a member of this family?

00:41:56.263 --> 00:41:57.431
Sure it is.

00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:01.602
I don't think hiding the truth will
lead to this family's happiness.

00:42:01.685 --> 00:42:03.521
I think it will!

00:42:04.104 --> 00:42:06.232
That is how we have worked things out

00:42:06.899 --> 00:42:08.150
for the past 15 years.

00:42:10.152 --> 00:42:12.863
Ko was prepared to
put his life on the line

00:42:12.947 --> 00:42:15.658
in order to protect Leo and the family.

00:42:15.741 --> 00:42:17.326
And you messed it all up!

00:42:17.409 --> 00:42:18.827
Messed it up?

00:42:18.911 --> 00:42:22.039
Ko would not have
wanted you to do this either.

00:42:24.083 --> 00:42:26.252
You just changed his charge from

00:42:27.044 --> 00:42:30.089
murder to harboring a criminal.
There's no point!

00:42:31.298 --> 00:42:34.343
Leo said that he can feel better now.

00:42:35.344 --> 00:42:36.887
I can't believe you!

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:39.765
I feel like this was the right choice.

00:42:40.599 --> 00:42:43.811
From an outsider's perspective,
it might seem wrong,

00:42:43.894 --> 00:42:47.398
but protecting Leo
was our family's "truth."

00:42:48.899 --> 00:42:53.404
It's not the same as the "truth"
you see from a legal perspective.

00:42:53.487 --> 00:42:58.867
I thought it was the best thing to do
for the family and for you as well.

00:42:58.951 --> 00:43:01.036
That's why I took Leo to the police.

00:43:01.912 --> 00:43:04.707
I wanted to close this case for your sake.

00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:08.252
You said you wanted to
find out the truth too, didn't you?

00:43:09.795 --> 00:43:14.592
But I didn't want it to end like this.

00:43:18.304 --> 00:43:20.514
If this was going to happen,

00:43:22.725 --> 00:43:25.311
I wish I had been the killer.

00:43:28.022 --> 00:43:30.274
I don't want you to be the killer!

00:43:31.191 --> 00:43:32.735
Your family is important to me too,

00:43:33.527 --> 00:43:36.864
but we can't find happiness
in our marriage unless we overcome this.

00:43:36.947 --> 00:43:38.157
You get that, right?

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:39.408
I don't get it!

00:43:40.868 --> 00:43:44.038
I was more than happy
with how things were.

00:43:49.418 --> 00:43:50.919
I can't anymore…

00:43:51.503 --> 00:43:52.880
Why?

00:43:55.883 --> 00:44:00.095
Everything has fallen apart
because I met you.

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:05.976
We weren't supposed to meet each other.

00:44:16.236 --> 00:44:18.030
Please divorce me.

00:44:30.167 --> 00:44:32.211
It has been one month

00:44:32.294 --> 00:44:33.337
since Nella and I got divorced.

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:36.632
If you like her that much,
why did you divorce her so easily?

00:44:36.715 --> 00:44:38.342
Nella hasn't come home in two days.

00:44:38.425 --> 00:44:39.551
Are you going to let Nella die?

00:44:40.177 --> 00:44:41.428
There was one more secret

00:44:41.512 --> 00:44:44.264
{\an8}that led to this incident.

00:44:44.348 --> 00:44:45.099
{\an8}THIS DRAMA IS FICTION

00:44:45.182 --> 00:44:46.141
