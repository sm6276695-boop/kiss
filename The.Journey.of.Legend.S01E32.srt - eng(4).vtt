[The Journey of Legend]

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.930
[Episode 32]

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.920
Mr. Fei,

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.440
is something wrong?

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.180
If this is the real Thousand-Faces Mask,

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.730
cut off from a living person for so long,

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.150
without the Fei family's internal energy
to sustain it,

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.610
it should've dissolved
into blood long ago.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:10.520
But look,

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.640
the skin is still intact.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.470
It's clearly a fake.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.870
But how could that be?

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.690
This object is connected
to a few major cases in the martial world.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.040
It's more than just your family's affair.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.090
My father's sword?

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.829
Why is my father's sword in this coffin?

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.410
Is my father the one buried here?

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.520
Mr. Fei,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.390
just speak plainly.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.710
If word spreads
that the Thousand-Faces Mask still exists,

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.750
it will cause a huge storm.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.320
When that happens, the Fei family

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.760
will definitely be doomed.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.680
Five years ago,

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.870
when Danfeng returned from his mission
for the Imperial City Division,

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.960
he was hunted by Zhu the Great King.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.870
I rushed to his aid,

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.630
but on the way, I encountered
Zhu the Great King's subordinate,

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.750
Lord Roushui.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.150
I thought he was the one hunting Danfeng,

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.520
so I used all my strength to kill him
with the Marrow-Disrupting Finger.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.520
But when I removed his mask,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.360
I discovered it was my own son, Danfeng.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.490
Danfeng!

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.100
Danfeng!

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.630
After that, I crippled my internal energy

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.240
and vowed never
to use the Marrow-Disrupting Finger again.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:47.370
Grandfather,

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.320
my father...

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.760
was killed by you?

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.280
Grandfather, give me back my father!

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.829
-Young Master!
-Give me back my father!

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.750
Grandfather, give me back my father!

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:57.290
Let's go, Young Master!

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.620
Give me back my father!

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:59.970
Grandfather!

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.280
Grandfather.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.050
Mr. Fei.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.390
What grudge did Zhu the Great King have
against Fei Danfeng?

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.170
To be frank,

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.550
the martial arts of the Fei family
were never top-tier

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.550
among the Three Mystical Families.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.050
It was only
because of the Thousand-Faces Mask

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.400
that we could establish ourselves
in the martial world.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.560
That day, Danfeng was following
the Imperial City Division's secret order

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.520
to secretly investigate
Zhu the Great King's identity.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.810
He discovered
Constable Tieyi is Zhu the Great King.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.290
To get the Thousand-Faces Mask,

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.460
he tricked me into killing Danfeng.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.930
Zhu the Great King is Constable Tieyi?

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.460
Could it be he was the one
who fabricated the story

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.290
that Baicao Valley colluded
with Northern Wasteland?

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.690
If the Thousand-Faces Mask
is in his hands,

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.760
the one who disguised himself as Chief

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.390
and tricked me
into killing Tianzheng and Taichan

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:54.510
must have been him.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.510
What's done is done.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.060
I'll say no more.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:02.640
Mr. Xiao,

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.520
I hope in the future, you'll

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.690
give an explanation
to everyone in the martial world.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.350
No matter what bloodshed
the Thousand-Faces Mask stirs up again,

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.320
prove that the Fei family
has nothing to do with it.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.480
Please.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.250
Mr. Fei, no need for such formality.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.770
[Taiji Palace]

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:19.520
Chief Li,

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:20.990
it's getting late.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:22.130
Please.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.250
[Daxi's emperor]

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.730
I, Chenzhou,

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.810
pay my respect to Your Majesty.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:35.520
Chenzhou.

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:37.820
Chenzhou, you're here.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:40.520
Long time no see,

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.290
and you're still as impressive as ever.

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:42.820
I thought

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.930
you didn't want to drink with me anymore.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:45.810
Come. Hurry.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.330
Join me for a few drinks.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.400
Sit down quickly.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:50.640
Look,

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.000
I'm thoughtful, right?

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:54.090
The dishes I prepared
are all your favorites.

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:54.480
Here.

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:55.330
Hurry.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.090
Eat.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:02.640
The waterway transport was tedious.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.100
I only reached the capital
after nightfall.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.660
Sorry for disturbing you.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.220
After all this time apart,

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.050
you're still so impatient.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:12.930
Fine.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.370
Let's discuss business first.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.490
[Memorial]

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:19.100
Look.

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:20.880
This memorial states

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.880
a censor has accused your Power Gang

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.560
of misappropriating treasury assets

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:27.490
and distributing them
to various sects in the martial world.

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:29.350
It states the Power Gang took 90%,

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:32.179
and the other sects in the martial world
took 10%.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:34.760
Is that true?

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:47.270
I am guilty, Your Majesty.

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:49.450
Winter has come in the north,

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.760
and the soldiers lacked food and clothing.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.820
I couldn't bear it.

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:55.770
So I sent 90% of the treasures
to the front lines.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.450
The war situation was critical

00:08:58.450 --> 00:08:59.910
and could change rapidly,

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:02.610
so I didn't report this matter.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.130
In this matter,
I indeed overstepped the bounds.

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.290
I willingly accept punishment.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.220
I see what you mean.

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:16.520
You mean

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.250
I was thoughtless

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.480
and neglected the soldiers.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:27.590
Since that's the case,

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.190
there's nothing more to say.

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:31.280
Chenzhou,

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:33.690
drink this cup of wine

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.060
and you may leave.

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:52.130
Chenzhou.

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:55.430
I'll go get you an imperial physician.

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:56.100
No need.

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:01.260
I knew about the memorial of accusation,

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:02.260
so I rushed here.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.330
Actually,

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:06.860
you didn't need to come here yourself.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:08.920
Perhaps His Majesty wouldn't have...

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:09.720
Prince Liang,

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:13.590
do you think the snow falls

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.290
because of a single day's cold?

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:24.670
I always thought

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:28.570
you angrily left the court
and wandered the martial world

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:32.240
because you were dissatisfied
with many of the court's policies.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.330
As a prince,

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:36.430
I'm inevitably burdened
by the state affairs,

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:39.870
constrained
within these uncomfortable official robes.

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:47.160
Now, seeing you risking your life
to remonstrate,

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.490
I finally understand why you did all that.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.450
Now I know
my past judgments were prejudiced.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.610
I'm so sorry.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.880
Throughout my life,

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:05.000
my actions have been like
a wild goose treading on snow.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.680
What others think of me

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:08.740
doesn't matter to me

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.210
at all.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:13.890
Hearing you say that

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.360
reminds me of someone.

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:21.130
But when the wild goose flies away,
who'd care if it goes east or west?

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:22.400
If one day you're gone,

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:24.550
in this vast world,

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:27.890
who can accomplish the tasks
you left unfinished?

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:33.720
Your Majesty,

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.810
after the Power Gang

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:38.080
took the treasures from the Nantian Abyss,

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:41.090
they indeed converted them into supplies
and sent them to the front lines.

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:42.610
Trying to buy loyalty?

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.410
Did you find the object?

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:49.060
The men I sent
were outmaneuvered by Li Chenzhou.

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:52.500
The Royal Seal was not found
at the Nantian Abyss.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.040
Your Majesty, please calm your anger.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.040
Please punish me.

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:00.330
Chenzhou's little schemes

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:02.980
won't stay hidden much longer.

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:05.250
Now that he's afflicted
with that severe poison,

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.370
he has to come to me every month

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.920
to beg for the antidote to stay alive.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:13.050
I'd like to see how tough he is

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:15.020
and how long he can hold out.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.260
Your Majesty, you're wise.

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:19.640
With your support, the waterways

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.570
already possess the capability

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:24.030
to rival the Power Gang
in the martial world.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.060
It won't be easy for Li Chenzhou

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.250
to cause trouble.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.010
Enough, Constable.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:32.880
Rise.

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:35.010
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:37.980
Daxi and Northern Wasteland
have seen incessant wars these years.

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:40.040
The people have suffered immensely.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.240
It weighs heavily on my mind.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.730
Li Chenzhou has toiled for so many years.

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:46.330
It's time for him to rest now.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.160
From now on,

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.960
the martial world of Daxi
will be entrusted to you.

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:53.120
Do not disappoint me again.

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:56.910
I will serve with utmost dedication.

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:24.710
I saw what you did at the Fei family.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.520
You said in front of everyone

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:30.980
you despise bullying the weak most of all.

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:32.370
Xiao Qiushui,

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.410
I want to ask you for a favor.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.000
Will you help me or not?

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:40.570
You've been following me.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.330
Do you know about the calamity
that befell the Xiao family?

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.330
I don't know who harmed your family,

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:47.910
but I know the truth

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:51.160
about what Danfeng was investigating
back then.

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:07.780
You want to use that
as payment for my help?

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.570
Fei Yuqiao, Master of the Fei family.

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.370
I should have died long ago.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.090
But I am unwilling.

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:27.680
Look at my face.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.660
This is the consequence
of using the Thousand-Faces Mask.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.540
So using the Thousand-Faces Mask

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.210
for a long time

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.700
actually results in this.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.250
That's not all.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.920
Every time the mask is used,

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:51.070
it greatly depletes one's internal energy.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.680
With the slightest carelessness,

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.140
one's life will be at risk.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.880
The Fei family established its place
in the martial world

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.940
because of the Thousand-Faces Mask,

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:01.850
yet was also destroyed by it.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.520
Everyone in the martial world
covets the mask.

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:06.990
Look at the Fei family.

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:07.849
For its sake,

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:10.849
we fought to the death.

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:16.190
Back then, I removed the mask
and went into seclusion while I was weak.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.720
But I was betrayed by my servant,

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:23.030
becoming a wandering ghost.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:28.160
So you want me to help you
reclaim the mask?

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:29.830
No.

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:34.480
The Thousand-Faces Mask
is now adrift in the martial world.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.280
It could cause widespread harm.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:37.920
I just want to find it

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.010
and destroy it completely.

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.440
Why do you trust me?

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.810
Being a ghost for so long

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:50.240
has made me see people more clearly.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.530
Xiao Qiushui,

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.090
I'm sorry about your parents' death.

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:58.010
Though we weren't close,

00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:00.990
your father was the hero I admired most.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:02.580
Let me tell you,

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.880
the person who hunted Danfeng back then

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.770
also used the Marrow-Disrupting Finger.

00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:10.870
Zhu the Great King?

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.130
Correct.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:16.200
I transcribed the technique into a manual

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.680
and lent it to Constable Tieyi.

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:21.640
He must have memorized it then.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.090
Find Constable Tieyi

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:27.330
and destroy the Thousand-Faces Mask
in his possession.

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:28.660
The Fei family's object

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:33.090
must not be allowed to create
more scumbags in the martial world.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.480
Mr. Xiao.

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.480
Mr. Xiao,

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.570
please!

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:42.370
Sir.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.120
Thank you.

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:05.870
I finally found you.

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:08.160
This is your retribution!

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.160
Tell me,

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.810
how to cure it?

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.290
My face is your future!

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.090
No one can cure
the Thousand-Faces Mask's backlash!

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:19.690
The martial world has one more monster,
neither human nor ghost!

I've been waiting for you.

Aren't the Long River waterways enough
for you to occupy and enrich yourself?

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.090
You've actually colluded
with Northern Wastelanders.

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:54.550
What exactly are you up to?

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.770
Colluding?

00:20:58.740 --> 00:20:59.800
Enriching myself?

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:03.160
I'm not that shallow.

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:04.610
Look.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.360
At the Nantian Abyss,

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.010
did I ever ask you
to seize a single coin for me?

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:15.050
Li Chenzhou is the one enriching himself.

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.330
He converted half of the treasures
at the Nantian Abyss into supplies

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:24.130
and sent them to the front lines.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.240
But that's not what His Majesty
wants to see.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.680
As I told you last time,

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:36.240
if the war between Daxi
and Northern Wasteland continues,

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.200
it will exhaust our people and resources.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.260
No matter how much treasure we have,
it only fills holes

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:43.910
and disappears with each battle.

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:47.690
I'm just trying
to ease His Majesty's burdens.

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:49.750
If that's really the case,

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.530
why didn't you tell me clearly before?

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.220
You tricked me into going
to the Nantian Abyss

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:56.620
and made me lose all face.

00:21:57.290 --> 00:21:59.610
The Xiao family's reputation
built over generations

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:00.880

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.680
I would ruin anything

so he personally wrote 4 characters
as a gift to your family.

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.530
Fifth Thug! Fifth Thug!

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:55.720
You're finally back, Fifth Thug!

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:56.380
Fifth Thug.

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:57.440
Eat.

00:26:58.610 --> 00:26:59.530
You have some more.

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:00.290
I want it. I want it.

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:01.330
Give it to me. Give it to me.

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:02.060
Give it to me.

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:04.510
Fifth Thug.

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.390
You came here for treatment, right?

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:11.480
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:12.780
Originally,

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:14.740
our arms and legs fixed by Miss Tang

00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:17.180
just didn't work properly occasionally.

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:18.920
You did that on purpose!

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.480
Gradually, we've gotten used to it.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:23.610
But it's inconvenient for us
to travel in the martial world.

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:24.470
You once told us

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.850
that Xueyu is kind-hearted

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:28.130
and skilled in medicine,

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:29.370
and she can cure us.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.480
We came to look for her before

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:32.740
but couldn't find her.

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:34.480
So we came again today.

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:39.640
But right now, she is at the medicine hut.

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:42.110
I also came here looking for someone.

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:46.130
Your issues seem
to be with your joints and meridians.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:47.230
How about this?

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:48.320
I have a good friend

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:49.810
at Biechuan Temple.

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:51.090
He's called Grand Master Dayin.

00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:51.880
Go to him.

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:54.390
Tell him you're Xiao Qiushui's friends.

00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:56.130
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:56.850
That's great.

00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:57.920
Since you're already here,

00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:58.960
go in and have a seat.

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.420
-Sure.
-That sounds good!

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:01.920
-Let's go in and have a seat.
-Sounds great.

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.610
Fifth Thug, your house is so big.

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:04.810
-Do you have anything tasty?
-It's so spacious in there.

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:05.330
That's right.

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:05.960
We want something delicious.

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.240
Yes, of course.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.850
How has everyone been lately?

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:10.920
Pretty good.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:11.650
Pretty good.

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:14.010
We saw a murder on our way here last time.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:14.960
That's right.

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:16.160
Someone was murdered.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.160
It was that damned Constable Tieyi.

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:19.850
-Yes.
-I had wanted to kill him for ages.

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:21.530
He was pushed off a cliff by someone.

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:22.530
Constable Tieyi?

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:23.850
That's right.

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:24.680
Yes, yes.

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.130
Yes, it was him.

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:27.480
That old jerk.

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:29.610
I had wanted to kill him for ages.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:31.210
Second Thug,

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:33.920
you were talking about Constable Tieyi
from Liushan Sect?

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:34.530
Yes.

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:34.910
It was him.

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:36.040
It was that old jerk.

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:37.920
Then tell me,

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.260
what happened?

00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:42.250
After we parted ways,

00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:44.160
we felt the inconvenience
of our arms and legs for the first time.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.920
So we wanted to come to Xueyu for help.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:47.120
On the mountain path,

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:48.590
we saw a person in black

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:50.980
push Constable Tieyi off the cliff.

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:58.850
Mur... Mur...

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.810
I never expected you to be so ruthless.

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:28.590
You killed so many people.

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:35.480
Are you sure

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.050
it was really Constable Tieyi you saw?

00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:40.330
-Yes.
-Yes, how could we be wrong?

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.090
-We couldn't possibly be wrong.
-Even if my eyes blurred,

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:43.330
we had 8 eyes in total.

00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:44.090
Right, 8 eyes.

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:44.920
We couldn't all be wrong.

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:45.640
Exactly.

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.850
We had played cat and mouse
with that old fox

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:48.160
-for so many years.
-So many years.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.810
We'd recognize him
even if he turned into ashes.

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:51.130
Yes. Second Thug is right.

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:52.640
Fifth Thug, if you don't believe us,

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:53.850
I-I'll take you there to see for yourself.

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:54.920
-It's right at the bottom of that cliff.
-Yes.

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:55.960
The body might still be there.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:56.440
That's right.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.370
It must be there.

00:29:58.290 --> 00:29:58.820
Let's go.

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:00.330
Let's go take a look.

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:01.850
Let's go.

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:04.190
-Let's go.
-We're not having tea?

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:09.340
-Fifth Thug, over here.
-Fifth Thug, over here.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.050
He did know
how to use the Marrow-Disrupting Finger.

00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:39.250
It seems Constable Tieyi is truly dead.

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:47.610
Then the current Zhu the Great King
in the martial world

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:50.940
must be the killer disguised
with the Thousand-Faces Mask.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:54.400
Four Thugs.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.740
Before he died, he said

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.680
that person in black killed many people?

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.290
-Yes.
-That's right.

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:01.420
This place is humid.

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:03.160
Even if the body was exposed for months,

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.290
it shouldn't be this shriveled.

00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:06.810
In the novel, the Asura Seal technique
in the Voidheart Codex

00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:08.480
seems to be able to absorb others' power,

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.810
leaving the victims as dried-up corpses.

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.290
What martial art could do such a thing?

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:15.500
Could it be the Voidheart Codex?

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:18.430
-The... The Voidheart Codex?
-The Voidheart Codex?

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:20.120
Did I overlook something?

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:30.510
Four Thugs.

00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:31.630
Listen,

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:34.480
go quickly
and find Zhu the Great King's lair.

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:35.580
-No problem.
-Okay.

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:36.510
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:41.620
[Xiao Residence]

00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:54.400
Someone secretly practiced
the Voidheart Codex carved in Sword Manor

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.720
and then destroyed it.

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:57.280
Could it be...

00:31:58.090 --> 00:31:59.240
someone had been lurking

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:01.170
in Sword Manor just like Zhu Xiawu?

00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:03.680
Li Chenzhou said

00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:06.540
when Liu Suifeng arrived that day,

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:10.020
Sword Manor had already been breached
from within.

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:13.900
Sword Manor was impregnable.

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.080
Breaking in from the outside

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.200
was nothing easy.

00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:21.540
Big Brother,

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:23.640
when Yuhan and I led people
to collect the bodies,

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.400
we already discovered that the Qianji Lock
at the back of Sword Manor

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:26.330
had been opened.

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:40.010
Huanhua's Qianji Lock is very intricate

00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:42.740
and extremely difficult to break.

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:52.090
Though the Qianji Lock is small,

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:55.720
it contains 2 mechanisms.

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:57.090
Two mechanisms?

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.680
It's completely different
from any lock you've seen.

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.960
To open it, it requires

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:10.090
simultaneous action
from both inside and outside.

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:13.680
Both inside and outside?

00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:16.210
Both inside and outside?

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.240
Only someone

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:25.590
who understands the Qianji Lock
can open it.

00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:26.530
He killed everyone,

00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:27.920
took the Thousand-Faces Mask,

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:30.350
and disguised himself
as Zhu the Great King.

00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:31.680
Only Father, Mother, and my 2 brothers

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.140
know how to open that lock.

00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:34.860
Impossible.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:36.800
Yiren and Kaiyan

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:39.000
both arrived at Sword Manor after I did.

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:39.970
Impossible.

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:41.810
This is impossible.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:33:59.610
Big Brother,

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:02.240
you've already done everything you could.

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.970
Don't blame yourself anymore.

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:07.530
That day, your brother Kaiyan
went ahead to scout the path.

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:09.610
He returned
saying the road ahead was blocked.

00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:10.870
With no other options,

00:34:10.969 --> 00:34:12.429
Yiren had to take a detour,

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:14.850
which delayed us considerably.

00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:18.280
Then how did Kaiyan

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:20.889
get back?

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:23.090
After he got separated from us,

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:24.719
he fought his way through all obstacles

00:34:24.719 --> 00:34:26.179
to get back to Sword Manor.

00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:27.840
It was you.

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:31.800
Qiushui.

00:34:33.969 --> 00:34:35.239
I went to buy osmanthus cakes.

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:36.900
I heard they say you came back,

00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:38.889
so I specially brought you some.

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:43.530
Xiaoyi,

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.170
are Yiren and Kaiyan...

00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:48.719
in Xiao Villa now?

00:34:49.949 --> 00:34:51.199
Yiren has a meeting with someone

00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:52.239
and isn't in the villa.

00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:55.239
Kaiyan seems to have gone to Pipa Pavilion
for drinks.

00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:56.090
Xiaoyi.

00:34:58.050 --> 00:34:58.850
What's wrong?

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:02.610
Nothing.

00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:37.180
[Winning over Luzhou's governor
by offering him power and a high position]

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:39.920
[Some of our elite soldiers
have infiltrated merchant caravans]

00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:43.600
[Investigate
the military deployments at Qiliang Pass]

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:44.480
[It is crucial to our subsequent plans]

00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:50.280
Qiushui?

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.000
What brings you here?

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:09.390
Today, I happened
to have prepared a table of dishes

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:12.330
our parents loved when they were alive.

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:15.650
You're in for a treat.

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:32.120
Try some.

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:42.320
Mother always loved

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:46.300
brewing tea for us in the past.

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.050
At that time,

00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:51.770
she loved making all kinds of pastries.

00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:57.490
In those days,

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:02.740
I always thought
I could enjoy them forever.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.170
Unfortunately,

00:38:10.930 --> 00:38:12.050
Mother's cooking

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:18.660
is something we can never taste again.

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:31.490
Why bring this up?

00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:34.680
Why talk

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:37.750
about such sad things?

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.240
Father and Mother

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:50.000
died so unjustly and unclearly.

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:53.090
Kaiyan,

00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:56.890
I still can't figure out

00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:02.740
who

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:07.890
could hate them so much.

00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:26.280
Life is unpredictable.

00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:30.320
Nothing is certain.

00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:13.460
Then just reset.

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:14.770
Reset

00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:16.970
and buff the character
with more golden cheats.

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:17.840
You're R.

00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:21.970
You're quite clever.

00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:23.610
R.

00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:26.280
Li Nan, it really is you.

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:28.570
Xiao Kaiyan.

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:53.490
What is this about?

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.840
Why have your martial skills

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:03.890
improved so much?

00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:05.360
Qiushui,

00:41:07.350 --> 00:41:09.970
are you the only one allowed
to have fortuitous encounters?

00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:11.570
Am I not allowed to work hard?

00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:13.430
Then tell me,

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:16.650
when did you

00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:21.220
learn these unorthodox techniques
from others?

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:24.390
Is it the Voidheart Codex?

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.710
I don't know
what nonsense you're talking about.

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.280
Stop pretending.

00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:47.420
The method to open Huanhua's Qianji Lock—

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:50.650
Father only told us 3 brothers.

00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:58.680
You're still quibbling!

00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:23.460
Who's out there?

00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:24.640
Father!

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:26.210
It's me, Kaiyan!

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:28.090
It's Kaiyan.

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:39.720
You returned to Sword Manor in advance

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:42.250
and secretly practiced
the Voidheart Codex.

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.570
You killed our parents

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:47.410
and destroyed the entire Xiao family!

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:51.930
Tell me,

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:53.720
why?

00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:55.320
Why?

00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:58.980
Why did you do that?

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:05.860
Why?

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:07.560
Father.

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:09.090
Mother.

00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:10.660
You're... alright?

00:43:10.930 --> 00:43:12.530
Where are Yiren and Qiushui?

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:14.970
They'll be here soon

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:16.810
with the branch disciples.

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:19.860
I can't believe Qiushui actually did it.

00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:23.000
He did it. He did it.

00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:26.090
Why?

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.740
You were the most favored
in the Xiao family.

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:34.340
You always encounter
good fortune and opportunities.

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:37.530
Of course you don't know why!

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:42.130
I, Xiao Kaiyan,

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:45.670
rely on my own efforts
to change my own destiny.

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:47.490
This time,

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:49.160
I will take back everything!
