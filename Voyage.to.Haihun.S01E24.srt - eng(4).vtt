=Voyage to Haihun, Season 1=

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.260
=Episode 24=

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.710
(On the 14th day
of the 8th month, 74 BC,)

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.600
(28th day of the 6th month,
Yuanping Year 1,)

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.550
(the 27th day
since Liu He ascended the throne,)

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.610
(summoned by the Empress Dowager,)

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.700
(Liu He knew his fate
could no longer be changed,)

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.200
(but there was nothing he could do.)

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.120
(As he stepped into the hall,)

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.760
(he saw the Empress Dowager
sitting under the armored curtains,)

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.760
(and all officials
had long been waiting there.)

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.370
(It felt like a judgment
that had awaited for ages.)

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.630
Your Majesty.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.360
All officials have gathered in the hall.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.200
Lord Huo.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.030
Do you mean to depose me?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.150
- I...
- As the Great General,

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.840
you've mobilized troops
to slaughter commoners.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.810
How should such a crime be judged?

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.710
Your Majesty,
you mustn't make such false accusations.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:30.710
False accusations?

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.710
Right now, are your troops

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.000
outside Wucheng Village?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.640
Wucheng Village is full
of suspicious wandering heroes,

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.730
plotting rebellion.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.310
I sent soldiers to suppress them

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.630
for the peace of the Han.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.100
I summoned those heroes

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.090
in Wucheng Village.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.240
Withdraw your troops now.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.740
Since you ascended the throne,

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.310
you've abandoned
benevolence and filial piety.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.720
Your continuous reckless acts

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.370
have already endangered the realm.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.980
And now,
you ask me to spare those traitors.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.820
This is utterly absurd.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.190
They hold the realm close to heart,

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.190
wishing to serve the Court.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.250
Yet you, as the Great General,

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.630
block them at every turn.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.470
It must be because you feel guilty.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.400
The city is filled with troops.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.840
Why would you employ men
of unknown origin?

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.800
Who do the troops in the city obey,

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.440
me or you?

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.390
The soldiers naturally answer to you.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.680
Good.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.190
Then, I command them to withdraw.

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.250
Your Majesty,

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.040
if you so readily trust
these treacherous men,

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.160
do you know the consequences?

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.640
I'm risking my life to urge you
not to repeat your mistakes.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.570
As I expected,

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:55.960
the soldiers

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.320
still

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.150
heed only your command.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.520
You leave me with no choice.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.240
Your Majesty.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.790
Please don't.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.990
- Your Majesty.
- Don't!

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.910
Withdraw the troops.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.930
Your Majesty.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.360
You want me to relinquish the throne.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.760
Very well.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.980
I shall grant you that.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.030
The throne is not something

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.210
to be treated as a game.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.570
Isn't this exactly
what you loyalists wished for?

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:40.950
Fine.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.160
I can step down.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.060
But I have two conditions.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.910
First,

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.260
withdraw your troops
from Wucheng Village at once.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.160
Second,

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.190
the men from Changyi in the Palace

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.160
must not be harmed in the slightest.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.430
Your Majesty, please behave yourself.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.850
Stop making mistakes.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.600
If my blood stains here today,

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.190
how will later generations speak of it?

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.100
The Great General, Huo Guang,

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.040
failed to force Liu He to abdicate

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.760
and was blinded by greed and ambition,

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.450
forcing Liu He to his death

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.880
right there in the hall.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:22.800
Aren't you known

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.580
for putting the Han above all?

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.870
If the history books

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.000
were to record this incident,

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.240
what would they say?

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.080
Your Majesty.

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.980
Withdraw the troops.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.420
Alright.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.800
Guards.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.330
Pass down the order to retreat.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.600
- Great General, bad news.
- Speak.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.400
A sudden battle broke out
in Wucheng Village.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.640
Flames rose high into the sky.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.390
It's now nothing but scorched earth.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.240
What?

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.900
No one in the village survived.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:22.630
Your Majesty.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:23.920
I believe...

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.760
Huo Guang.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:26.240
You slaughtered the innocent.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:27.970
I sentence you to death.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.580
You are no longer the Emperor.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:31.700
You've lost that right.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.160
Your Majesty.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:35.750
I believe

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.990
Liu He cannot bear
the Mandate of Heaven.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.310
He cannot serve

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.000
the ancestors

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.360
or treat the common folk with kindness.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:44.600
It is only right

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.040
to depose him.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.170
I, as the Prime Minister,
have a memorial to present.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.350
Since His Majesty ascended the throne,

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:55.800
during the morning period,

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.480
he refused to have a vegetarian diet

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.000
and indulged in wine and revelry,

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.140
so that all rites were abandoned.

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:05.950
By the 27th day,

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.100
the offices have been requisitioned

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:14.760
for 1,127 items with tokens.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:20.010
On the way to Chang'an,
he once seized common women.

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:21.350
(They're all dead.)

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.120
We repeatedly remonstrated with him,

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.430
(They're all dead.)

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:25.820
but he turned a deaf ear,

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:27.430
acting with unchecked arrogance,

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.630
and growing worse by the day.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.190
He indulges in immoral conduct.

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:32.680
(They're all dead.)

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.430
His self-discipline has collapsed.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.870
I fear the realm
will soon fall into chaos.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:42.750
Thus, I risk my life today to speak up.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.810
Your Majesty, please decide.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.480
Your Majesty.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:59.750
I second this petition.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:13.670
Approved.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.020
It is said that the Emperor,
with seven loyal advisors,

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:35.810
though unworthy,

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.400
will not lose the realm.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.300
Now, not one able minister remains.

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:43.360
All are fickle and follow the wind.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.450
The officials of Changyi

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:50.990
have served without ability

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:52.800
and given false service to the state.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:54.710
General Han.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.280
Yes.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:01.510
Arrest and imprison them all at once.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:03.480
Execute them today.

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:06.870
Surround them all.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.480
Seize all

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.740
the remaining traitors.

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.320
His Majesty has abdicated,

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.720
yet the realm outweighs the ruler.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.020
Therefore,

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.040
I would rather forsake His Majesty

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:45.270
than betray the realm.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.550
I can no longer remain by your side.

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:52.880
Your Majesty,

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.360
please take care.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.990
(On the 27th day)

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:05.750
(of Liu He's reign in 74 BC,)

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:09.660
(he was deposed
by Great General Huo Guang.)

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.000
(When Huo Guang looked
at Liu He trembling in fear)

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.160
(and saw his anxious back,)

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.520
(he suddenly felt a pang of compassion.)

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:18.870
(He understood)

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:23.130
(Liu He simply lacked the ability
to bear the weight of the realm,)

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.960
(yet he was not a man
of great treachery.)

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.950
(As long as Liu He remained alive,)

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:32.170
(Huo Guang could answer
to Emperor Wu's dying wish)

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:36.430
(and preserve his name
as a loyal minister.)

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:45.640
Indecision

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:46.750
leads to chaos.

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:48.180
Indecision

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.500
leads to chaos.

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:50.720
Indecision

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.220
leads to chaos.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:53.480
Indecision

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.810
leads to chaos.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.580
Indecision

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.010
leads to chaos.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.590
Indecision

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:01.270
leads to chaos.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.020
Indecision

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:04.730
leads to chaos.

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:06.180
Indecision

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:07.790
leads to chaos.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.100
Indecision

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.600
leads to chaos.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.240
Indecision

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:14.050
leads to chaos.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.480
Indecision

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:17.370
leads to chaos.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.070
Indecision

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.770
leads to chaos.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.350
Indecision

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:23.910
leads to chaos.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.880
Indecision

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.280
leads to chaos.

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:28.880
Indecision

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:30.440
leads to chaos.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.230
Indecision

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:33.800
leads to chaos.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.600
Indecision

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:37.410
leads to chaos.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:39.590
Head to Wucheng Village.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.240
Hyah!

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.010
Hyah!

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:21.090
Hurry, run!

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.000
You're sent by Huo Guang, right?

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:10.790
He deposed me just to make it easier
to kill me, right?

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.010
Come on!

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:13.610
I have never known fear.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:31.680
Hyah!

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:07.550
(If I hadn't told Liu He the end
written in history,)

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.940
(he might not have rushed into action,)

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.670
(and history might've taken
a different turn.)

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:18.710
(I thought
I could alter the course of fate,)

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:22.950
(but I only made the ending
far more tragic.)

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:46.240
Liu He,

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:47.600
I'll save you

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:49.000
once more.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.100
