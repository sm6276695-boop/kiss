[When Destiny Brings The Demon]

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.500
[Based on the JJWXC novel "When Destiny Brings The Demon" by Fu Hua]

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.460
[Episode 33]
[I want you to stay, I will find you]

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.290
Mount Hu really is

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.890
the entrance to Nine Nether Purgatory.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.620
You Yan came to the Hu Kingdom

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.140
to release his demonic soldiers,

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.860
so he could rise again

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.340
and conquer the cultivation world.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.860
You kept me in the dark.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.340
Had your memories never returned,

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.500
wouldn't everything have been delayed?

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.220
Before I came to the mortal world,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.370
I cast a secret spell on the crown

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.140
passed down through each emperor.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.410
Once the coming-of-age ceremony is over,

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.250
my soul will be complete,

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.090
and I will recover the memories of my past life.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.690
You've made a good plan, haven't you?

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.780
So you came here

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.650
to destroy You Yan completely.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.090
But why do you also intend to open the Nine Nether Purgatory?

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.970
You Yan can't be killed outright.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.620
The only way is

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.690
to open the Nine Nether Purgatory

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.340
and seal him inside,

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.740
so that he'll never return to the three realms.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.180
I see.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.500
You plan to turn his scheme back on him.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.130
But the Hu Kingdom is only a small country.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.340
How could the mountain endure such overwhelming power?

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.130
A thousand years ago, the Hu Kingdom

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.340
was known as Mount Feng.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.090
It was the birthplace of the Fengshan clan.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.060
After sealing You Yan,

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.940
they fused the key to open the mountain

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.340
into the body of the Hu Kingdom's emperor.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.300
You're only a mortal now.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.060
How can you stand against You Yan?

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.300
That isn't the concern for now.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.740
If

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.850
You Yan means to aid the Marquis of Nanyan,

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.090
we could draw him out

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.570
through the Marquis.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.060
I've sent Chen Tang and Nianjiu to investigate.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.530
In the Marquis's dungeon,

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.250
they found many corpses of boys and girls.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.180
Noble Consort Si Xian

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.370
was also killed by You Yan.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.530
To usurp the throne, the Marquis of Nanyan

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.810
caused chaos at the canal,

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.020
brought drought,

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.900
and even took innocent lives.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.940
Yet nothing favored him. He even lost his daughter

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.530
and was stripped of his post by you.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.020
I suppose he's eager to retaliate.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.850
Give him an opening,

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.690
and his intent to rebel may be revealed.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.500
I'll create that opening for you.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.740
No.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.090
It'd be a waste to use our wedding this way.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.220
Whether for the worship ritual

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.780
or to lure You Yan,

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.900
we'll marry, after all.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.650
Besides...

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.620
I have no idea

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.660
how powerful the demonic energy in me will become.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.810
If the demon core loses control,

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.420
I might as well perish with it.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.810
If Sima Jiao learns of this,

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.690
his plan will be disrupted.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.980
What's on your mind?

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.690
I'm thinking,

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.660
I have waited far too long for this moment.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.370
I don't want to wait anymore.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.500
Let's be married this time.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.810
Sure.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:58.740
I'm sorry.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.620
I just promised we would be honest with each other,

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.060
yet I've gone back on my word.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:06.740
But at least

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.890
I can leave you

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:10.940
with some good memories.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.420
The imperial court will open the granaries

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.420
to relieve the people.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.500
Each commandery shall lighten forced labor and reduce taxes

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.770
to ease the people's burden

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.740
and guard against future calamities.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.010
Victims of the disaster

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:30.860
shall be exempt from this year's tax.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.570
Your Majesty shows great wisdom.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.330
Besides,

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.060
Madam Yan is conferred the title of the Empress.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.540
That's all.

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.860
How could a criminal woman be made Empress?

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.940
Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.100
In light of Noble Consort Si Xian's death,

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.180
Madam Yan's innocence hasn't been proven.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.660
How can she be named as Empress?

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.100
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.570
Please think again.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.180
I've found the culprit

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:04.810
behind Noble Consort Si Xian's death.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.180
It was not Madam Yan.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:09.330
After the worship ritual,

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.770
I'll tell you the truth.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.980
My daughter's body is barely cold,

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.210
yet Sima Jiao rushes to crown that demon consort!

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.100
Simmer down, my lord.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.210
Madam Yan has grown weaker these days.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:35.420
Her pulse is thin and frail,

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.180
her power is failing.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.010
Now is the perfect time

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.770
to make our move.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:43.770
Are you sure?

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.540
Who are you?

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.810
No need to be anxious.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.940
She's here to help me.

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:50.860
This is Yi Huo,

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.100
the imperial physician.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.250
Her words can be trusted.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.620
Looks like Liao Tingyan has lost most of her cultivation.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.810
She can no longer oppose me.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:03.300
Marquis of Nanyan,

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.770
now is the time to bring Sima Jiao down.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:09.210
If he weds and completes the worship ritual,

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.660
he will inherit the imperial seal,

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.890
and the Hu Kingdom will have a true emperor.

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.060
If you hesitate again this time,

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.500
you'll lose the chance once and for all.

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:26.980
Sima Jiao,

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:29.740
you're ignorant and unjust.

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.010
Don't blame me for showing no mercy.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:37.860
Madam,

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.500
please lend me your aid.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.330
Don't worry.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.740
You only need to seize the throne,

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:50.980
I'll see to your success.

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:53.740
Once it's done,

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:56.130
I'd like to borrow the imperial seal.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:01.210
Your Majesty,

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:03.420
the Marquis of Nanyan and the demonness at his side

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.420
believe Madam Yan has weakened.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:07.250
Everything proceeds as you planned.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:09.660
In that case,

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.860
we shall wait for the worship ritual after the wedding.

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:19.940
Miss.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:21.370
Can you hear me, miss?

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.210
The dreams are getting stranger.

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:33.690
They're all about the modern world.

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.420
All of this began

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.660
the day I fed the Spirit Blood with my blood.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.060
If I fully suppress the demon core,

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.450
not only will I die,

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:56.210
but my soul will leave this world as well?

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:34.140
Madam,

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:35.610
the wedding preparations you ordered

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.090
have already been arranged.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:38.260
Good.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.660
A wedding must be lively and joyful.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:48.020
It's getting late.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.210
You should rest.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:50.540
No.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.020
There are many gifts I haven't finished.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.060
You can always make them later.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:01.420
You can rest now.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:02.540
Don't worry about me.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:04.900
Yes, Madam.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:11.570
Sima Jiao,

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:14.450
I'm afraid that when You Yan is sealed,

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:17.300
the demon core inside me will break loose.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:19.850
When that happens,

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.810
I'll burn myself away to destroy You Yan for you.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.260
Before I vanish,

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.780
I must leave behind as many keepsakes as I can

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.420
so that you won't be so lonely in the days to come.

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:39.570
I welcome Your Majesty and Your Highness

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.040
to the worship ritual.

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:11.290
Your Majesty,

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:12.050
they're here.

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:17.050
Protect His Majesty!

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:46.290
Your Majesty,

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:48.530
you're outnumbered.

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:50.770
Save your strength.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.140
Uncle, you're indeed shrewd

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:14.450
to have planted such a pawn by my side.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.100
Entrusting me to you is truly a wise decision

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.620
made by the late emperor.

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:23.770
If you surrender the throne,

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:25.970
for the sake of our years together,

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:28.450
I'll spare you.

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:31.620
Sure.

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:35.100
If you wish to shoulder

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:37.290
this ruined country,

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.490
I'll gladly step down.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.050
You sure know how to make the smart choice.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.660
In that case,

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:50.250
please stamp your seal on this decree of abdication.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.580
Take the imperial seal if you wish.

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.820
You can stamp it

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.940
anywhere you like.

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:34.860
Guards,

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:38.690
kill this useless emperor!

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.100
My lord, you promised me

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:41.940
you'd only take the throne

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:43.250
and kill the demonic woman,

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.660
but spare His Majesty's life.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:45.900
Keeping him alive

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:50.050
is like raising a tiger that will turn on us.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:02.940
Marquis of Nanyan,

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.140
you conspired with the Demon Race, slaughtered children,

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:05.730
brought drought,

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.420
and framed the Empress.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.210
Your crimes deserve death.

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:11.180
Grand General,

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:13.340
don't be deceived by him.

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:15.180
I concealed many of his crimes,

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:16.290
but he

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.530
killed my whole family.

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:23.820
So you planned this

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:26.450
long ago.

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:27.340
Guards,

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:29.970
arrest the Marquis of Nanyan.

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:30.860
Yes.

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:31.690
Who dares!

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:33.770
I am the Emperor of the Hu Kingdom.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:51.820
Madam,

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.140
help me kill these traitors

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.380
and ascend the throne!

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.490
With this imperial seal,

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.450
why should I waste the effort?

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:02.290
Marquis of Nanyan,

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.380
don't you see you're serving evil?

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:07.210
Your daughter's death

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:09.900
was caused by the so-called Madam.

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:11.380
Nonsense!

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.900
It was Liao Tingyan who killed my daughter.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:15.900
My lord,

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:17.970
those children died the same way

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:19.940
as Noble Consort Si Xian.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:21.530
How can this be?

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:24.660
Madam is an immortal.

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:25.530
It can't be.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.140
Look at her now.

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:30.100
Is she an immortal or a demon? It's obvious.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.940
Save yourself while you still can.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.580
I knew you'd come.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.250
You didn't lose your cultivation?

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:54.380
Now,

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:56.100
what's done is done.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.380
There's no turning back.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:16.250
Tingyan!

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:38.100
Sima Jiao!

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:45.620
Sima Jiao.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:46.210
Your Majesty.

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:48.970
You mustn't die. Wake up.

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:52.770
Sima Jiao, you...

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:54.210
Wake up.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.620
Wake up.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:58.490
Sima Jiao.

00:22:59.070 --> 00:22:59.860
Hang in there.

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:01.210
Hang in there.

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:02.770
You must hold on.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.380
I lost you once.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.580
You must hold on.

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:12.970
Don't worry.

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:15.860
You mustn't die.

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:17.730
Don't...

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:24.250
No.

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:25.900
No.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:28.340
No.

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:30.100
His Majesty...

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:32.100
I can't feel his pulse.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.180
Sima Jiao.

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:36.970
Sima Jiao.

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:40.380
Sima Jiao.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.690
Sima Jiao!

00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:56.900
It's the Life and Death Thunder Tribulation.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:45.620
Fellow demonic soldiers,

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:47.420
I'll take you

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.620
out of this wretched place.

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:50.180
The Demon Realm,

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:51.730
Immortal Realm,

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.210
and Mortal Realm

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.690
will all become your hunting grounds.

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:05.580
Never!

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.580
The Nine Nether Purgatory holds the strongest demonic energy.

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:18.050
If you won't surrender your cultivation,

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:20.900
then become my puppet.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.250
Even if I become a demon,

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.530
I will kill you

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.380
to uphold justice.

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:26.940
You're only seeking death.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.660
Burning your body

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.340
just to kill me?

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:17.490
You Yan.

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:22.820
You were supposed to be dead.

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:34.970
Why do you still have Spirit Fire?

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:37.250
I rekindled it

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.100
at the origin of the Fengshan clan.

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.250
What's there to be so shocked about?

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:47.140
Look closely.

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.290
This is the fire you lit for me.

♪What does this fading dusk conceal?♪

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:03.460
♪The sorrow of never-ending fate...♪

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:07.620
What is this?

Where are my demonic soldiers?

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:11.340
You Yan,

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.010
didn't you always

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:15.140
want your Demonic Army back?

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:16.580
I'll grant you

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.250
that dream.

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:21.420
You Yan thought the imperial seal could open the mountain.

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:22.690
But little did he know,

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:24.730
I'm the true key.

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:26.340

when you fused with it?

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:40.690
Yes.

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:42.820
After the fusion,

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:45.250
it reforged

00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:46.770
with the last descendant of the Sima clan,

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:49.620
and was rekindled by the Spirit Fire

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:50.820
in your body.

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.140
If it survives another Life and Death Thunder Tribulation,

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:56.210
it will transform into a new,

00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:57.940

do you have the confidence?

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:15.050
No.
