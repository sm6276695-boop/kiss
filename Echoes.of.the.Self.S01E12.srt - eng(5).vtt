00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.430
Why?

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.630
You've arranged everything
so meticulously.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.310
Have you ever asked if I want to leave?

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.870
Have you ever asked
if I want to go to Liangzhou?

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.920
I'm about to become the principal daughter
of the Zhou family.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.349
On what grounds do you think

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:06.400
what you've arranged for me

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.440
is the best?

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.170
Don't blame me.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.520
If you have to blame someone,

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.650
just blame Heaven for giving us both

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.130
identical faces.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.310
Since you

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.950
don't want to be the Crown Princess

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.380
and refuse to be above all other people

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.880
as the future empress,

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:44.789
why don't you

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.990
let me take this chance

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.740
to defy Heaven and change my destiny?

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.780
From now on,

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.560
in this world,

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.230
Zhou Ruoxi will no longer exist.

I'm fine.

is the best?

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.160
Why don't you

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.839
let me take this chance

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.040

Please don't do that.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.780
With the second stroke,
it'll bring wealth.

With no desire to be alive,

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:15.500
her soul will definitely scatter.

As for what to choose,

it's up to this young lady.

In everyone's lifetime,

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.510
fate is predetermined.

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:56.550
We shouldn't force it.

00:15:58.710 --> 00:15:59.630
Nor should we

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.500
go against the trend.

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:06.470
What fate?

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:08.700
I never believe in fate.

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:10.280
In this world,

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.640
there's no fate I cannot conquer.

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:26.290
This is fate.

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:31.090
Why is your pulse...

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:33.280
It's the pulse of a dead person.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.440
I am already

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:44.630
a dead person.

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.720
Since the moment I just returned,

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:51.530
I've been a dead person.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.369
I have no pulse.

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:24.069
That was why in the suburbs,

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:25.730
Xi thought I was dead.

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:32.800
I'm actually not the Princess of Daqing.

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:36.090
I don't even belong to this world.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.310
I am Zhou Ruoxi
from 3 years in the future.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.480
3 years in the future?

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.400
I'm that lowly

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:49.310
concubine's daughter from the Zhou family.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.000
I know my own ending.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:55.570
I also know everyone else's ending here.

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.530
The day when I first met you in this life

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.000
was the day

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.190
when my mother died in my previous life.

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.990
Mother!

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:06.920
Go away!

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:07.840
In that life...

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:09.210
Mother!

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:10.430
I couldn't save her.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.160
Later,

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:16.140
to take revenge,

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.180
I made my eldest sister

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.360
marry Li Shu...

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.010
and give up on you.

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:31.960
But in the end,

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:36.400
you still died because of me.
