00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.480
{\an8}I don't know what the future holds,

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.800
{\an8}but my love for you will never change.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.040
{\an8}And we'll never
let go of each other's hands.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.480
{\an8}I just wish
I could freeze time right here,

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.480
{\an8}just the two of us.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.520
{\an8}If you're still in contact with Tawan,

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.040
{\an8}I'll destroy everything with my own hands.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.960
{\an8}Dad!

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.520
{\an8}Get her out of my house. Now!

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.920
{\an8}Can you check your messages?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.120
{\an8}We sent you something.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.000
Here are the color tones.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.840
Five shades in total.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.760
What is it, Kie?

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.960
Look at this.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.240
{\an8}VIRAL BUZZ! LOOKALIKE OF SINGER A.L.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.600
{\an8}SNAPPED IN INTIMATE MOMENT AT THEME PARK

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.520
Comments are flooding in.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.760
{\an8}IT'S OVER

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.000
{\an8}HERE COMES THE NOSY AUNTIE!

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.400
{\an8}BUT WHY SNEAK AROUND THOUGH?

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.000
{\an8}Call Ayla. Right now.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.480
I already did. She's not picking up.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.160
Should we try calling Mr. Thana?

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.080
Go ahead. Connect me.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.680
Good afternoon, Mr. Thana.
Please hold for a moment.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.160
Mr. Thana, I need to speak with you
about something important.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.440
Yes?

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.360
I'm sorry, Mr. Thana,

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.560
for my inappropriate behavior,

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.240
sneaking in to see Ayla at home

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.560
and taking her out

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.000
without your permission.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.080
I'm ready to take full responsibility.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.640
I'm sorry, Dad.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.080
I really am.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.320
You saw the reporters outside, right?

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.720
What do you plan to do next?

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.040
Can I have my phone back first?

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.520
I need to call the label.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.880
I guess I don't need to remind you
how being a singer works.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.040
With this kind of scandal,

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.200
things don't look good.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.920
Hello, Boss.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.960
Yes, I've seen it.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.440
Tomorrow at noon, I'll go live
and make a public statement.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.520
Okay.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.000
I'm really sorry

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.120
for dragging you into this.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.800
Don't worry about it.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.120
I've had a hunch for a while now,

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.600
but I kept forgetting to ask.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.120
And when I finally got the answer,
it came with a picture!

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.720
I couldn't sleep all night!

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.840
I sincerely apologize

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.080
for causing all this trouble.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.200
Why are you apologizing, Ms. Rawee?

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.720
You didn't do anything wrong. This one!

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.080
This little troublemaker did.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.640
Right? You started all this.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.880
Excuse me. Are you ready, Ayla?

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.760
I'm ready.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.120
You sure?

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.120
- I'm good.
- Okay.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.800
Wish me luck, okay?

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.480
I'll be right here.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.600
Not going anywhere.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.920
Good luck!

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.200
Alright, we're rolling.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.680
{\an8}- I LOVE YOU, AYLA!
- NEVER REGRET LOVING YOU

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:15.800
{\an8}Hello, everyone.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.440
{\an8}Today, I'd like to clarify the photo

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.040
{\an8}and news
that's been circulating on social media.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.480
{\an8}- WHAT HAPPENED?
- I'M HEARTBROKEN

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.200
The person in the photo is me.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.360
And the woman beside me

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.559
is the person I love most.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.679
She was my first love back in high school.

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:45.440
Back then,

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.240
I was just a nobody
sitting in the back of the class.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.760
But once I met her,

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.960
once I fell for her,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.920
I wanted to become a better person.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.440
{\an8}She supported me,

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.120
and encouraged me to follow
my dream of becoming a singer.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.120
Until one day,

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.920
something happened that tore us apart.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:22.280
I didn't know what it was
or where she went.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.160
But ever since,

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.040
{\an8}I've pushed through everything.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.120
{\an8}I trained hard,
singing, dancing, all of it.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.600
I endured it all,

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.760
{\an8}so that one day, I could be the singer,

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.480
so that I could stand in the spotlight…

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.800
{\an8}- I'M SUPPORTING YOU
- WHO IS SHE?

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.280
{\an8}- WHY?
- DON'T TELL ME…

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.080
{\an8}In case she might see me again.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.600
{\an8}That's why

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.360
{\an8}I don't want to let go of her now.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.440
{\an8}- WHO IS SHE?
- OOPS…

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.640
{\an8}WHAT A DESTINY!

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.760
{\an8}And now, we've found
our way back to each other.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.240
{\an8}LOVE YOU!

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.880
{\an8}We're holding hands again.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.240
{\an8}NEVER FELT JEALOUS OF HER UNTIL…

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.760
{\an8}We're in love again.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.160
{\an8}WHAT A NOVEL BASED ON TRUE STORY

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.240
I'm truly happy.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.600
{\an8}IT'S YOU, ONLY YOU

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.720
{\an8}I'm truly happy.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.000
{\an8}WHO IS SHE, AYLA?

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.280
{\an8}JUST LIKE A MOVIE!

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:35.520
{\an8}This is why
I don't want to let go of her ever again.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.720
{\an8}PLEASE TAKE CARE OF HER FOR US

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:37.920
{\an8}ROMANTIC!

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.800
{\an8}I never meant to lie to my fans

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.040
who love and care about me.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:48.720
{\an8}ROOTING FOR YOU!

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:49.680
{\an8}LOVE YOU, AYLA!

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.280
{\an8}Thank you all…

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.600
{\an8}SENDING HUG TO YOU

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.200
{\an8}…for always loving and supporting me.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.640
{\an8}YOU LOVE HER, I GET IT

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:57.920
{\an8}LOVE YOU NO MATTER WHAT, AYLA

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.480
{\an8}But if today,

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.400
{\an8}any of you decide to stop loving me…

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.480
{\an8}PLEASE DON'T CRY

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.720
{\an8}…I'll understand.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.880
{\an8}And I'll accept it.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.200
{\an8}- IT'S NORMAL
- SENDING HUG!

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.720
{\an8}Thank you so much, everyone.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.960
{\an8}IT'S YOUR PERSONAL LIFE

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.720
{\an8}LOVE YOU THE SAME

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.040
{\an8}AYLA'S SO BEAUTIFUL!

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.720
{\an8}IT'S JUST NORMAL, PRIVATE THING

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.840
Should we end the live?

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.960
Cut to wide shot. Give me a wide frame.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.360
Boss… But people…

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.520
It's fine.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.480
Love is a beautiful thing.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.800
No matter what happens,
I'll stand by Ayla.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.040
Wide shot.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.040
Wide shot.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.720
Wider. Wider.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.760
{\an8}YOU'RE SO CUTE TODAY. LOVE YOU THE MOST!

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.120
{\an8}LOVE YOU

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.360
{\an8}LOVE YOU AS ALWAYS

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.280
{\an8}THIS IS IT!

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.840
{\an8}I WANT SOMEONE TOO!

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.840
{\an8}FEELING LIKE A VICTIM NOW

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.400
{\an8}THEY'RE IN LOVE!

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.160
{\an8}JEALOUS!

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.400
{\an8}I JUST WANT TO BE LOVED

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.600
And this is Tawan.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.200
{\an8}WHAT A CHEMISTRY!

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.920
My girlfriend.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.360
{\an8}CAN I HAVE YOUR GIRLFRIEND, AYLA?

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.600
{\an8}SO SWEET!

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.520
{\an8}- I'M SHIPPING AYLA-TAWAN NOW
- THEY'RE MADLY IN LOVE

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.880
Zoom in!

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.480
{\an8}WISH TO HAVE THIS KIND OF MOMENT MYSELF

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.920
{\an8}I'M OPENING A COUPLE FANBASE NOW

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.720
{\an8}I'M MELTING!

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.960
{\an8}LOVEBIRDS!

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:03.720
End the live.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.560
Okay.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:12.960
We're so lucky
the fans are supportive.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.680
I'm so happy for you both.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.160
Really.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.120
Thank you so much, Boss,
for understanding us.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.400
Don't mention it.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.800
You two didn't do anything wrong.

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:34.560
Your love is beautiful.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.800
No matter what kind of love it is,

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.560
we shouldn't be shutting it down, right?

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.600
Ayla!

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.920
Whoa, whoa, easy!

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.480
Ayla, you are… everything! Literally!

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.640
Seriously, I watched the live today.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.320
Tears in my eyes!

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.640
The love between you two… It's just…

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.680
I can't even find the words. It's just…

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.640
- It's…
- It's perfect!

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:18.320
Yes! Exactly!

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.000
Tawan is…

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.200
so handsome!

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.200
Girls,

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.920
aren't you supposed to be practicing
your singing and dancing?

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.920
Go rehearse. Go on.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.880
Boss…

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.360
No more whining! Go rehearse, seriously!

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.440
Fine.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:39.440
Yeah.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.080
But…

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.760
we're officially Tawan's fangirls, okay?

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.360
Ayla, can we?

00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.400
Go rehearse.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:00.840
Now, all of you!

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.320
Go, go.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.640
Go rehearse!

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.480
Oh Lord.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.040
Ms. Rawee,
you're getting super famous now.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:18.400
If you're ever interested
in joining showbiz, just let me know.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.120
I'll personally manage you.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.680
Totally famous!

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.000
Right after the live,
we got tons of offers

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.920
for couple interviews and talkshows.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.760
If you're interested,
I can help coordinate right away.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.280
We'd rather not.

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.280
I don't want Tawan to feel pressured.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.440
Just having everyone accept us

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.320
is more than enough.

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.600
We're happy just being together like this.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.200
As long as you're happy.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.240
Dad,

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.840
your precious daughter is causing
more drama for the family again.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.200
Look at this.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.520
Everything you've worked to build…
It's ruined.

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:14.880
VIRAL BUZZ! LOOKALIKE OF SINGER A.L.
SNAPPED IN INTIMATE MOMENT AT THEME PARK

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.240
That Tawan is so shameless,

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:19.960
thinking she can date a superstar.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.720
And now?

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.240
The fans are cursing.

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:27.079
They are flaming our whole family.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.000
Where are the comments insulting us?

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.480
And where are the ones cursing Tawan?

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.040
Here, look, Dad.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.000
{\an8}GO EARN YOUR SNACK MONEY

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.440
{\an8}NO NEED TO ACCEPT GIFT BASKETS

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.160
This account is your burner.

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.000
You think I don't know?

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.120
Stop being so jealous.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.400
It's not manly.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.960
Sorry I'm not as manly
as your favorite golden child.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.080
Excuse me. Mr. Songklod
would like to see Ms. Rawee.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.280
Songklod?

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:35.040
Mr. Songklod is the president
of T.S. Construction,

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:38.520
one of the top five construction companies
in the country.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:39.600
A total giant.

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.680
Hello, Mr. Songklod.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.400
Hello, sir.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.920
Come home with me. Now.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.080
No.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.680
You head home first.

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:12.000
Once I'm done here,
I'll come talk to you myself.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.760
Haven't you caused enough trouble?

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.760
Are you planning to stay

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.600
and drag our name down even further?

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.160
And who exactly is so disgraceful?

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.000
You bastard.

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.440
Not just a bastard,

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.360
a complete bastard.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.360
Talking nonsense as usual.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:56.920
Who's talking nonsense?

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:58.920
You or me?

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.960
What right do you have

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:09.680
to call my daughter
a disgrace to your kid?

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.120
Am I wrong?

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.560
Social media

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.320
is already digging
into my daughter's entire past!

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:19.680
- So what?
- She's become gossip fodder.

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.040
You scared?

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.080
Afraid your own skeletons

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.640
are gonna come out of the closet?

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.320
Huh?

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:50.600
Tawan, come home with me.

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.600
And stay away from his daughter.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.320
Remember this.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.960
No one in our family

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.720
will ever be associated with theirs.

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:04.680
Good!

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.520
Take your daughter and go.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.560
But you better make sure

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.440
she stays away from mine.

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.680
What? You think
your daughter's some kind of saint?

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:16.640
She's better than yours!

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.320
Stop fighting already!

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.080
Why is it that the people who support

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:28.200
and understand us aren't our own dads?

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.120
Isn't our happiness important too?

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.440
Why can't you just be happy for us,
for the fact that society accepts us now?

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.960
Or are the things in the past
really that important?

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.240
- Tawan, come home!
- Ayla, come home!

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000
I think the two of you
should go home for now.

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.080
Talk things through there, okay?

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.040
Trust me.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:20.760
Ayla?

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.120
Ayla.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:27.720
Don't show respect to him.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:55.920
Listen to me.

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.200
You should forget about Tawan.

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:00.680
It's just not possible.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.880
I can't accept
being related to that Songklod.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:07.840
I just can't.

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.080
Just seeing his face
makes me want to punch him.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.680
Even though you know

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.240
I'd be heartbroken if I broke up with her?

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.400
You heard everything
I said in the live, didn't you?

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.360
You know how much I love her.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:29.240
You know she's been
my biggest inspiration.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:33.120
And you think I can just let that go,

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.880
just because
you and her dad don't get along?

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:42.520
If you're worried about
the fans or society not accepting us,

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.480
that's not even the case anymore.

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:48.200
If you're scared my singing career
will fall apart, it hasn't.

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.560
People are praising us.

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:53.040
They want us to appear on shows together.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.880
The only people who still don't accept us
are our dads.

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:06.120
And it's not even because
we're two women in love.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.240
Tell me honestly, Dad.

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:17.160
Can't you forgive Tawan's father?

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.880
I just can't, sweetheart.

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:19.680
- Hey!
- Wait up!

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.120
How are you doing, Boss? Exhausted?

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:25.040
I even prepared balloons to celebrate.

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.280
I thought…

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.400
Why's the mood all gloomy again?

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:36.920
I was going to show her all the comments--

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.840
So, Mr. Thana still won't budge, right?

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.280
Right.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.720
My dad showed up to stir things up.
It nearly turned into a fistfight.

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.760
Double the drama.

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:09.600
Documents from T.S. Construction
just arrived for the boss.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.280
That was fast.

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.720
I'll go grab the documents then.

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.040
I think you should shut your company down

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.400
and come work for me instead.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.440
I'm not cut out for your business, Dad.

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.920
I didn't even study in that field.

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:33.640
It's not that hard.
I can teach you everything.

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:38.040
Don't reject it just yet.
Think it over first.

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.400
And what about you and Mr. Thana?

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.400
Do I really need to say anything more
about that man?

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:53.320
You've seen for yourself
what kind of person he is.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.640
I told you to break up with her

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.920
because I'll never make peace with him.

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.440
But we're in love.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:05.680
We're not breaking up.

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.040
Go study the company's operations.

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.880
And find time
to change your surname back too.

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:26.640
{\an8}ANNUAL MEETING SUMMARY

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.840
Here are the documents
from your dad's company.

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:33.040
It's quite a stack.

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:37.480
He wants me to come work for him.

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:39.040
Huh?

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:42.520
Are you shutting down the company?

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.360
Am I going to lose my job?

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.000
Oh, come on.

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.440
Stop jumping to conclusions.

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:49.680
Boss didn't say anything
about shutting down.

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:52.920
Boss, we're not losing our jobs, right?

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.520
You too?

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:58.400
Can't I feel afraid?

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:03.080
Finding a new job won't be too hard,
but I like it here with everyone.

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:15.480
Don't worry. I'm not shutting down.

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:55.280
Mr. Thana is inviting you inside.

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:08.040
Can you promise me

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.920
you won't sneak into this house again
to see Ayla?

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.040
If you love her,

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:19.920
then please treat her
with more respect than you have before.

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.080
Yes, Mr. Thana.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.000
Doesn't your father stop you?

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.880
Because I still can't see

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.280
how our two families
could possibly be connected.

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.120
He does try,

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:43.520
but I won't obey.

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.360
So stubborn.

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:49.920
Your family doesn't even accept her.

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:53.720
And you expect me
to let Ayla suffer like that?

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:58.400
She'll never be happy

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
living with someone so small-minded.

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:04.560
I will be happy.

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:15.600
As long as I have Tawan, I will be happy.

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.320
Let me say this once more,

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.280
just so you both get it loud and clear.

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:50.280
If you want to come see Ayla again,

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.640
then come properly. Use the front gate.

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.360
Don't pull any stunts.

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.440
Come to her with respect.

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.760
If you're going to be in her life,
do it openly.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.880
I know I can't stop you from meeting her.

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:10.760
But just because I'm not stopping you

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.360
doesn't mean I accept this relationship.

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.240
I just know it's useless to try.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:19.920
If you want to love each other

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:23.440
while making me miserable,
then do whatever you want.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:45.920
My family has nothing
to do with our relationship.

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:51.440
And Ayla doesn't need
to live in that house either.

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:55.960
What do you mean?

00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:01.600
I've never been accepted
by anyone in that house.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:06.000
Everything I've achieved,

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:09.160
I've fought for on my own.

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:15.000
So, please don't worry, Mr. Thana.

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:20.840
I won't let anyone hurt Ayla.

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.840
And what did we do wrong?

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.840
All we did was fall in love.

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:14.840
You have to break up with her. Understand?

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:18.040
Think about it.
What do you want to hold onto?

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.680
A love with no future

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.720
or a dream you built with your own hands?

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:31.120
You know how much I love her.

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:34.240
You know
she's been my biggest inspiration.

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:37.560
Can't you forgive Tawan's father?

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:40.200
I just can't, sweetheart.

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:43.120
I don't love you anymore!

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.600
I don't want to be here!

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.360
Get out!

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:52.440
I don't want to live here anymore!
I don't love you!

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:34.960
I love you.

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:19.520
GOODNIGHT

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:28.080
{\an8}MESSAGE FROM TAWAN

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:06.520
‪GOODNIGHT

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:45.000
This is your favorite. I remembered.

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.040
Thank you.

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:13.040
Why does it feel like

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:15.640
the fact that we love each other
is so wrong?

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:29.240
Tawan…

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:39.120
Do you really think we can be together
if both our dads refuse to accept it?

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:45.480
Just seeing each other's faces,

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:47.320
they nearly punched each other today.

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:56.440
Why can't I…

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:03.960
see any way out of this?

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:48.600
{\an8}How are you doing with your personal life?

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:49.560
{\an8}I'm exhausted…

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:52.080
{\an8}and really discouraged.

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:53.080
{\an8}But Mek is still Mek.

00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:55.800
{\an8}I just can't put any hope in him.

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:58.400
{\an8}Who's the frontrunner
for this bidding round?

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:00.200
{\an8}I don't care
what tricks you're planning to use,

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:02.600
{\an8}but I have to win this bid.

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:04.840
{\an8}Did you see the photo I sent?

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:06.720
{\an8}The choice is yours, Mr. Thana.

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:09.360
{\an8}Ayla!

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:30.120
