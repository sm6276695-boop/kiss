00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.430
(Song Joong Ki)

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.140
(Chun Woo Hee)

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.570
(Lee Joo Myung)

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.580
(Seo Ji Hun)

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.960
(My Youth)

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.630
(Episode 4)

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.970
Why won't it go?

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.010
Did some seawater get in earlier?

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.580
My dad bought this for me.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.090
Is it broken?

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.130
It just stopped for a second.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.450
Director!

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.080
Director!

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.620
I'm so sorry. Director!

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.189
It was going so well. What? What's the issue?

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.389
Wol Baek can't make it.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.159
- What? - He has the chickenpox.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.759
So what are we going to do about tomorrow's shoot?

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.929
What about the shoot the day after?

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.099
Oh, man! What am I going to do?

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.570
We're too far out. We can't come all the way back here.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.540
Hey, kid!

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.610
Do you live around here?

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.740
Are your parents at work?

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.279
My mom went to work at the factory.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.750
And my dad is a hack poet, and my mom...

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.289
He's not home much, so I don't really know where he is.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.189
- Why? - Well, look you.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.719
You're a sharp one, aren't you?

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.429
Could you give me your parents' number?

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.730
We're shooting a movie and holding auditions here on set.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.670
Was that opportunity coming my way...

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.010
a blessing or a curse?

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.909
Hey, where on earth did you find this kid?

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.809
He's amazing. Just amazing.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.049
How are you so good?

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.250
He's pretty good, isn't he?

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.250
- Really? - Yes.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.229
Our day in the sun is coming

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.760
Hae!

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.199
Mom!

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.769
Mommy's here!

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:15.770
Mom!

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.270
My handsome boy.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.409
Oh, my goodness!

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.340
Let's just move to Seoul for good.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.180
Now, all we have to do is make it big.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:28.610
I am...

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.620
going to be your manager from now on.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.619
That means we'll get to be together every day.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.389
What? If we go to Seoul, can I be with you every day?

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.390
Of course!

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.760
Oh, and I...

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.399
have something for you. Ta-da!

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.069
Gosh, shoes!

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.070
Go on, open it.

00:03:48.071 --> 00:03:50.700
I clung desperately to that nameless opportunity,

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.370
hoping it might be the thread that would hold our family together.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.340
Try them on.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.139
And the award for Best Actor goes to...

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.410
Sunwoo Hae for "Ihwa Wol Baek!"

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.779
At just 11 years old, he's our youngest winner ever!

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.150
Hello. I'm Sunwoo Hae. I played Wol Baek.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.289
I'd like to share this honour with all the children out there.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.390
Thank you.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.260
Grow strong, grow tall

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.599
No way.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.429
It only grants wishes if you have a pure heart.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.099
It's because of you your parents are gone.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.440
They're nowhere to be seen.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.710
This is killing me.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.250
Please don't leave a scar.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.649
("Beat and Bebop")

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:39.980
What do you mean he's been dropped?

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.150
Why? What's wrong with my Hae?

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.619
He's grown so much this past year.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.560
Who'd believe Hae and Tae Rin are only a year apart?

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.529
- Oh, Director, please... - Ma'am...

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.129
Please, just reconsider, won't you?

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.529
- Director... - Look, ma'am.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.829
We'll call you if a suitable role comes up.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.170
What "next time?" There is no next time, Director!

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.940
Mom!

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.849
Mom, we're going to get new sneakers now, right?

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.550
You're starting a diet. Starting today.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.220
The bigger you get, the smaller you must stay. Okay?

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.489
And I couldn't find a reason to quit.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.260
And I couldn't stop, either.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.200
Oh, Director. Hello.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.729
You know the movie...

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.569
You know Harry Potter, right?

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.069
See, I'm going to make the Korean version myself.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.169
Really?

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.340
I'm giving you the first crack. You have to take it.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.649
What could I possibly do?

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.979
Director, thanks to you, our Hae became an overnight star.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.779
Most cons begin with trust.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.849
So, would you like to go out and grab a meal?

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.559
("Ihwa Wol Baek")

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.020
The belief that it'll work.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.190
The belief that it's the real deal.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.159
- If we hadn't trusted him, - That con artist.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.929
We never would've had this debt.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.670
Just wait until I get my hands on you.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.500
If you hadn't trusted him in the first place...

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.340
All you had to do was doubt him.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.840
You're an idiot.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:12.740
You...

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.250
I'm so sorry.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.549
I must've been crazy.

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:23.759
My poor Hae...

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.360
I'm so sorry.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.289
Your dad is out there right now, hunting that punk down.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:29.930
He'll catch him soon, okay?

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.929
And then everything will be okay, right?

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:35.470
Everything will be okay.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.170
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:40.740
Because I'm small.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.010
No, because I'm big.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.950
You have no idea how much I love you!

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.380
You trust your mom and dad, right?

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.719
You have to trust us.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.920
Yes, I do.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.620
I think I learned too young...

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.829
that there's a certain comfort in disbelief.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.659
You have to trust us!

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.100
That all that glitters...

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.070
is not gold.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.939
The mother of Actor Sunwoo Hae, a victim of A Entertainment's fraud,

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.840
was found deceased in her home this afternoon.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.179
Sunwoo Hae, who was the first to discover the scene,

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.050
is currently holding vigil at the funeral hall alone.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.020
Back then, I think a thought crossed my mind.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.520
Hey! Get out of the way!

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.019
- Are they loan sharks? - Hey, get a shot of this!

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.629
You think dying solves everything? Is that it?

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.499
- Where's your father? - Aren't there any adults around?

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.659
- Say something! Talk! - Where did he go?

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.899
- Hey, that's enough. - You must know where your dad is.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.070
You need to sign this...

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.100
What's this?

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:48.939
- Unbelievable. - Hey!

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.469
- Are you his father? - No.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.039
Hey, mister! Sir!

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.739
- What about my money? - Stop filming!

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.509
- Hey, old man! - Hey!

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:57.719
Sign here...

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.520
Hey, where are you going? What about my money?

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:05.390
I didn't know how to act in a situation like this.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:08.860
Perhaps,

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:12.730
I was just waiting for someone to yell, "Cut."

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:17.339
Cut! Okay.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.440
Mom, let's go home!

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.170
A shoot always ends eventually,

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.010
and with it, the performance is over.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.280
I told myself this was just a scene,

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:36.650
and I was just playing a character in his place.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:40.520
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:44.260
- Happy birthday, dear Sunwoo Hae - Happy birthday, dear Sunwoo Hae

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.730
That my performance was okay.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.500
That it wasn't bad.

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.390
Of all the things to dream about...

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:22.229
Due to unseasonable weather conditions,

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:25.070
ship departures are being cancelled more frequently.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.099
For those of you planning a domestic trip,

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.840
why not head for the mountains instead of the sea?

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:32.939
The sea, with its refreshing, crashing waves.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.910
The mountains, full of lush greenery.

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.579
I already shared our schedule with you.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.050
I said we have an out-of-town shoot for Tae Rin's documentary.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:42.819
A shoot the moment we get back to Seoul?

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.990
And an emotional one at that?

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.330
Gosh, who schedules things like this?

00:09:58.770 --> 00:09:59.970
Je Yeon.

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:02.670
The CEO wants to see you.

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:04.809
Maybe this is for the best.

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:07.480
If it's gotten this much buzz, more people will watch the show.

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:09.649
Ma'am, I was just about to...

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:11.579
talk to you about that video that was posted.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:14.350
I kept trying to contact them, but they weren't having any of it.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.990
How can people be like this?

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:19.089
Something so sensitive and private...

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:20.589
I had it taken down.

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:22.790
It was a huge hassle.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:26.229
Thank you.

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:27.629
Thank you so much.

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:28.930
Oh, what a relief.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.139
You know how reporters are. They never take anything down.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.540
There was nothing wrong with the initial article itself.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:37.170
The punk who attached the video to the follow-up is the problem.

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:38.939
Keep a close eye on them.

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:40.709
Try to get on their good side.

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:42.010
See if there's anything else.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:43.979
Sunwoo Hae.

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.749
Even back in school, due to his financial struggles,

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.919
there were all kinds of rumours about him,

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.149
but none of them were true.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:51.289
He just seems to have lived an honest, hard-working life...

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:53.020
What, did you get attached to him instead of Tae Rin?

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:58.330
I just think you're worrying about the wrong thing, ma'am.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.769
The production team got the appearance contract signed, right?

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:03.569
If he changes his mind and quits over something this petty,

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:05.200
it'll cause trouble for many people. Check it yourself.

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:07.270
Yes, ma'am.

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:09.340
What do you mean they didn't get it signed?

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.379
I know he was added last-minute, but still...

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:16.309
That's not the kind of thing you just forget.

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:18.750
Hey, can you get it signed for me?

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:21.450
I'll email it to you right now.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:23.089
I won't.

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:25.220
Absolutely not. No way.

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:30.529
(Currently delivering happiness. Emergency contact)

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:31.630
A heart?

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:34.170
Is this what he's really like?

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:40.600
Where did the flower shop owner go?

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:44.940
Oh, I just got here too, but the door's locked.

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.680
I guess he's out.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:49.380
Out delivering happiness, I see.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:52.180
Goodness.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.789
Excuse me, but who are you?

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:02.429
And you are? What brings you here?

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:03.959
I have kimchi.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.529
I'm her co-worker...

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:08.129
No, a friend. Wait, an old classmate.

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:09.530
Oh, really?

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:13.769
Well...

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:16.469
I'm Hae's dad.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.209
Oh my goodness!

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:20.479
- Oh, hello, sir. - Hello.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.580
Hello.

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:24.380
I'm...

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:27.120
Oh, right. My wallet...

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.820
We're filming with Hae right now.

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:34.560
Oh, this is from her company.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:38.329
Is Hae doing okay?

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:39.899
I saw some bad news about him.

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.999
You must have come because you were worried.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.439
Yes, well... I don't know if I have the right to be.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.440
Hey, son!

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.010
Been out delivering happiness?

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:52.110
You're here?

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:55.309
What are you doing here?

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:56.310
What?

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:59.279
Oh, right! I made some kimchi.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.019
You know you've got to have kimchi at home.

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:02.420
I have kimchi at home.

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:05.589
You should go. We're closing soon.

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:09.460
Hey, it's the middle of the day. What do you mean you're closing?

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:12.699
Seeing you is all I needed.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.630
- You should head in. - Oh, no, it's okay.

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:17.200
Oh, right. Could you give this to him for me?

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.140
Hey, son, don't come out! I'm leaving.

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:23.610
You two have fun now.

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:25.539
See you around.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.110
- Bye. - Okay.

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.900
Where did it go?

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:49.900
So...

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:54.369
Are wilted flowers recycled?

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:57.239
Wilted flowers are just regular trash.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.240
I see.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:02.710
The blue ones you gave me before. They wilted, so...

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:05.650
Hey, you still had them in a vase?

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.390
Throw them out. It's an insult to the flowers.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:11.690
What are you smiling at?

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.230
What? Because you just put me in a good mood.

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:29.070
Sung Je Yeon.

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:32.680
Do you...

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:35.880
- find me awkward? - No, not at all. Why would I?

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:37.850
Oh, I guess not.

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:43.849
Then is it 1, you feel awkward, or 2, you feel sorry for me?

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:46.690
What kind of thing is that to say?

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:49.390
Neither.

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:56.100
Maybe I shouldn't have asked for a hug.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.939
About that video...

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.970
- The one in the article. - Yes.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.040
The CEO had it taken down.

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:05.880
I already thanked her on your behalf,

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:07.410
so you...

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:09.010
don't have to worry about it.

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:12.449
What do I have to thank her for?

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:14.590
Reporters rarely take articles down, you know.

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:17.920
She pulled some strings, so you should be grateful.

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:29.670
This is really bad timing, but...

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:31.540
Yes?

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.940
An appearance contract.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:38.280
I can't believe it came out today of all days.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.610
So that's why you're here.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.250
A signature.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:47.790
You'll sign it, right?

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:50.249
From now on, just...

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:51.820
get straight to the point.

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.190
Don't bother trying to make small talk.

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:59.459
No, that's not it. I mean...

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:00.900
Well, you're not wrong, but...

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:04.169
Seriously.

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:06.370
Everyone just walks all over me.

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:11.510
- Let me just fix your mic. - Oh, sure.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.850
You've had a lot on your mind these past few days, haven't you?

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:20.380
I'm sure this is why you hesitated to be on the show.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.250
Honestly, that didn't even cross my mind.

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:26.559
I had no idea that stuff was still out there.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.560
I'm sorry.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.760
If you're having second thoughts about this,

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:35.170
I promise I'll do my best.

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:37.870
No, that's not it.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.270
I just don't want to cause trouble for the show. That's all.

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:43.470
Until the very end,

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.480
I'll be counting on you.

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:48.910
Thank you.

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.650
- Thank you. - Thank you.

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.499
- Hey, Nu Ri. - Hae.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.240
Don't you think I deserve an explanation?

00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:13.370
Looks like they're filming something here.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:16.910
Where are you?

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:23.050
I can explain.

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:25.820
You're really money-crazed, aren't you?

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.289
I heard you have to pay to get on TV these days.

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:32.419
But you're too cheap to pay for something like that.

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:33.420
Not a chance.

00:17:33.421 --> 00:17:36.289
And the stations wouldn't advertise some random flower shop for free.

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:37.629
Definitely not.

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:39.460
- So what is it? - Well...

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.229
What are you even asking?

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:43.829
I just wanted to give you a hard time.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:45.199
Because you seem obsessed with money.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.970
- Excuse me. - Yes?

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:50.069
Here's the ice cream you ordered.

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.980
- Thank you. - Oh, and...

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.340
This is on the house.

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:57.010
You're always giving us flowers.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.789
Thank you so much. We'll enjoy it.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:02.790
Thank you.

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:09.690
Well, it's just...

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.459
It's going to show me now and footage of me as a kid.

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:16.469
Are you sure you were ever young?

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.870
And do you still go around town handing out your leftover flowers?

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.040
You'll get into real trouble doing that. Seriously.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.780
Eat your ice cream before it melts.

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:27.480
Eat up.

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:30.280
Good?

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:32.950
What?

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.619
Oh, I figured the director would be needing some coffee by now.

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:37.820
I see.

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:39.820
And you are?

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:41.190
Hello.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:42.830
I'm his younger sister.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.099
Are you on the shoot with my brother?

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.370
Gosh, you're all grown up.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.769
Hi, I'm...

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:53.099
the manager for the actress he's filming with.

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:54.709
Wait, how do you know me?

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:56.839
Are you and my brother already that close?

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:57.840
Well...

00:18:58.510 --> 00:18:59.910
You don't remember me, do you?

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:03.849
I used to read you books when you were little.

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:04.980
Books?

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:06.550
Books...

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:09.950
Just one little pebble fell out...

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:13.290
I like her too.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.770
Good luck with the shoot.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:23.600
Here, share this.

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.340
You just gave me something you were eating.

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.910
Nice to see you again!

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:32.340
She's really grown up so much.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:36.980
I guess she didn't see it.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.020
Thank goodness.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.720
Right.

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:43.419
Grow strong, grow tall

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:45.560
- This is you? - Yes.

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:47.929
- Got a problem with that? - What happened to you?

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:49.690
What's so wrong with me that everyone...

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:53.530
Oh, come on.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.030
But you've always seemed so big to me.

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:58.040
But he's so tiny here.

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:01.509
He's so adorable, though.

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:02.870
What, am I not cute anymore?

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:07.209
When are you bringing home your report card?

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:08.309
You're cute.

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:09.910
The cutest in the whole wide world.

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:12.679
- You're a real prize, aren't you? - Too late for that.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.749
It's not too late, is it?

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:15.849
Hey!

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:17.420
That woman from earlier.

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.019
That's her, right?

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:21.060
Get over here.

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.889
- Get over here. - But it is her.

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:25.900
Just how bad are your grades that you keep hiding them?

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:28.700
Hey, Eun Nu Ri, talk to me for a minute.

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:33.030
The weather's too nice. It feels like a waste to go home.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.030
Why isn't Je Yeon picking up?

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:38.099
How should I know?

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:41.609
I think she's pretty consistent with her hobby,

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:44.310
but she never tells anyone at work what it is.

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:47.410
She even bailed on hiking with me today.

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:49.750
So,

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.420
now I've got nothing to do after this.

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:54.720
So what's your point?

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:59.119
Why are you telling me this?

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.520
You're not busy?

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.860
Yes, I've got the day off from filming.

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:04.560
So I can come hang out, right?

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:07.359
Come on, I know you're bored too.

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:10.300
After the whole film crew was there, it must feel empty. Are you lonely?

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:13.100
We're seeing each other soon. Do we need to meet today too?

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:16.340
You want coffee, right? I'll grab some on my way, okay?

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:19.910
I'm telling you not to come.

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:22.510
Hello?

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:24.150
Hello...

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:26.880
She hung up.

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:51.679
Oh, hello there.

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:52.680
Hello.

00:22:52.681 --> 00:22:55.649
Excuse me, we're not from here. Could we ask you for directions?

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:57.580
I'm sorry, I'm lost myself.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:01.050
Oh, my goodness, you are?

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:04.089
But you have such a wonderful energy about you.

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:05.459
Oh, thank you.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.960
Do you happen to work in the arts?

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.899
It seems your ancestors were very virtuous people.

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:13.860
You know my ancestors?

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:16.930
I told you not to wander off on your own, honey.

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:19.340
Gosh!

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:37.750
Oh, you have company.

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:42.529
He doesn't seem to be with you. Should we help you out?

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:43.690
Want me to pretend I'm with you?

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.260
People like that always bother you when you're alone.

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.170
Thank you for your help.

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:56.270
I'm just really shy around strangers.

00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:59.680
I got anxious just watching you, so I had to step in.

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:01.950
You were anxious?

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:04.010
That you'd start crying again.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.720
You seem to have a pretty low emotional threshold.

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:10.620
What's a threshold again?

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:14.930
The minimum stimulus level required to trigger a reaction.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:19.700
Flippers?

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:22.030
Oh, I do free diving.

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:23.670
I see.

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:25.500
You must be great at holding your breath.

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:31.440
That's it?

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.180
Such a short reaction.

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:34.639
What?

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.179
That banner over there is long.

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:38.679
Maybe you could read it to me.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.220
(We read your fortune.)

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:47.320
So you're shy, but you're not afraid to speak your mind.

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:51.530
You must have it rough.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.960
Hey, why the sudden concern?

00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:57.869
Are you trying to hit on me or something?

00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:00.270
You're the one who almost got played a minute ago.

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:03.009
You think this is me hitting on you?

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:05.079
You dropped the formalities and called me "honey."

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:06.210
I was pretending we were together.

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:07.710
I see.

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:13.620
Still, "honey" was a little much.

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:16.190
So, where are you headed?

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:17.890
I hope it's somewhere close by.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:23.290
If I leave you on the street, I'm worried what someone might do.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.670
Well, this is my stop.

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:38.009
From now on, if you look in your phone,

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:40.639
there are tons of apps for maps, taxis, you name it.

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.610
So make that your new travel buddy and find your way home safely.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.950
Stop staring. You'll burn a hole through my face.

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:52.419
Are you always this nice?

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.089
You should be wary of people like me.

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:55.630
Don't just follow anyone around.

00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:59.259
Move it. You're blocking the entrance.

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:01.400
You move it. You're blocking the entrance.

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:05.370
Where does she get all that strength?

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:07.340
Does she take supplements or something?

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:10.469
And what's your deal?

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:11.779
I know, right?

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:13.980
Turns out we were going to the same place.

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.280
Gosh.

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:21.350
What's his deal?

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.520
"Honey."

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.820
"Honey."

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:30.230
"Honey."

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.759
Why would you be looking for your "honey" here?

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.459
Of all words, why "honey?"

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:36.029
He could've just said "friend."

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:38.799
Get a hobby or something and stop hanging around, please.

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.469
I just came from my hobby.

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:42.169
Want to join me? Free diving.

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:43.470
Why would you do something like that?

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:45.740
But if he'd called me "friend,"

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:48.179
would we have to be close enough to get drinks?

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:50.380
- Like you and Je Yeon. - Oh, right. Now I remember.

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:54.079
You were just like this as a kid. You never listened to anyone, right?

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.090
No.

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:58.419
Drinks? What a waste of money.

00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:59.460
Drinks?

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.089
I'll buy. Let me get you a drink.

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:02.090
No.

00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:06.730
I'm the one who knocked yours over earlier.

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:10.329
Thank you.

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:13.170
Fine, then I'll just ask Je Yeon to have a drink with me.

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.879
- The person you are calling... - Oh, she rejected my call.

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.879
I texted her that there was a fire. Think she'll come?

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:22.880
What was that?

00:27:22.881 --> 00:27:24.950
Oh, there's just something I didn't get to tell her.

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:26.820
I didn't ask.

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:29.590
Why not? I'm curious.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:34.189
- Hello? - What is it now?

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:36.190
I'm holding your actress hostage.

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:37.760
If you want her back, come get her.

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:41.460
Tae Rin, you said there was a fire! Where are you? Is it out?

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:44.770
Is anyone hurt?

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:46.940
What are you doing here?

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:50.610
Found you.

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:55.149
Oh, you're here too.

00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:57.479
I should hope so. This is my flower shop.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.580
Oh, right.

00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:03.150
What do you get when a flower shop catches on fire?

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:09.560
Fireworks.

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:16.729
Fireworks.

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:20.269
I don't make a habit of hitting women,

00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:22.369
but I'll make an exception for you today, Mo Tae Rin.

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:23.509
You startled me.

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:25.579
There's nothing for you to hit.

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:27.510
Oh, come on.

00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:29.549
Then how about I hit you instead?

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:32.180
- There's nothing for you to hit. - That's right. Not even worth it.

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:36.189
- Hey. - Yes? What is it?

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:38.119
Here. This is the study guide I made.

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:39.719
- I see. - Have Nu Ri use this to prep.

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.590
- I'm giving her a test this week. - Okay.

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:44.360
- And who are you? - A private tutor.

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:46.929
And who do you teach?

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:47.930
My little sister.

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:51.130
Oh, really?

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.500
Why would you trust this guy?

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.610
Hey, Sung Je Yeon.

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.779
Why don't you ever stand up to him?

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:06.980
What are you talking about?

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:10.790
Excuse me, but...

00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:13.919
If you're all finished here, would you all mind leaving?

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.260
Are you two are brothers?

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:16.629
Is it true?

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:17.630
- Yes. - No.

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:20.500
What?

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:24.970
We should get going.

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:27.469
Yes, let's get out of here.

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:29.339
- Leaving? Now? - We're going.

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:30.910
- We're off. - Okay, bye.

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:34.080
I'm off. See you tomorrow.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:35.880
Stay away for a while.

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:40.150
So we're not brothers after all.

00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:41.680
We're not.

00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:43.689
I wonder how long that'll be true.

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:45.019
Who knows?

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:48.060
If you'd bought that basket here, we might've been brothers by now.

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:50.829
You're still holding a grudge about that?

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:52.260
How adorable. Really.

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:55.930
You look like you're doing okay.

00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:58.070
I thought I saw some bad press about you.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.569
Maybe going broke as a kid gave you thick skin.

00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:05.070
The feeling of hitting rock bottom.

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:07.710
I know it all too well.

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:12.019
Takes all the fun out of teasing you.

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:13.120
Aren't you leaving?

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:15.720
All right, I'm going.

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:18.690
Well, this non-brother is heading out.

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:24.630
Make sure she preps.

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.300
Gosh, peace and quiet.

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:38.680
Right?

00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:40.010
About what?

00:30:40.011 --> 00:30:41.949
Remember last time, during the driving test?

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:43.980
We were the only two who failed.

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:46.319
I was so nervous back then.

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.320
I was babbling nonstop.

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:50.590
You don't remember me?

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:53.319
Just because we failed together, doesn't mean I have to remember you.

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:54.760
Your vehicle assignment is ready.

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:58.030
That was just last week, though.

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:04.499
I tend to only remember the things I want to.

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:05.599
I see.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.069
Well, since fate brought us together like this again,

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:10.609
let's make sure we pass together this time. Deal?

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:12.009
Don't you bail on me.

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:14.639
I'm so excited to make a new friend in Korea after so long.

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:16.080
You've got quite a personality.

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:17.780
Very bubbly.

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:22.619
Yes, well, in that case...

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:24.750
- Right. - Yes, see you next time.

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:28.360
I saw him last week.

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:31.090
We failed the test together.

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:33.800
Oh, the license number.

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:36.770
(Resignation)

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:44.869
If I accept this right away, will it seem like I expected this?

00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:47.409
Word gets around so fast around here.

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:49.350
I'm sure you must have suspected.

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:52.119
You were so influential at the company, after all.

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.480
And you mentored so many of our junior colleagues.

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:59.020
I haven't spoken to anyone else about this, so don't worry.

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:05.760
We should end things on a good note, right?

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:08.970
I want to say I'm rooting for you,

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:12.969
but I just can't today.

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:14.339
Maybe tomorrow will be different.

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:16.969
There was a time when I wanted to be just like you.

00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:18.110
More than anything.

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:21.980
Isn't that what every woman in our line of work says?

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:23.810
But...

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:26.449
as I watched you pave your way,

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:28.220
I started wanting to forge my own.

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:30.490
You know,

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:34.289
I used to like that you weren't afraid of me.

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:36.890
Well, I found myself growing more and more afraid of you.

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:40.560
Thank you for everything.

00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:58.180
Oh, dear.

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:13.660
May I ask why you're resigning?

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.070
Am I the only one who feels like this is out of the blue?

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.140
What kind of company would make you want to come to work?

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:24.940
Gosh.

00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:27.439
No one's ever asked me that before.

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:29.180
That's a really good question.

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:33.050
A company you want to work for? Where do you find one of those?

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:35.179
That's a utopia.

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:36.220
Not a company.

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:38.050
That's a pretty lame answer, though.

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:39.720
Gosh.

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:41.860
Well, for me...

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:45.400
I can't imagine this company without you two in it together.

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:49.699
At some point...

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:51.870
it started to feel awkward being around the CEO.

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:55.740
I began to question things, like her rules and her methods.

00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:59.410
Who am I supposed to whine to now?

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.249
What's your goal here at this company?

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:04.680
Are her beliefs truly your own?

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.290
Then what's your goal, Director?

00:34:09.890 --> 00:34:12.460
Me? To do things my own way for once.

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.730
No, to prove that my instincts are right.

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:26.900
Make sure you get enough sleep.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:35.749
No, Mom, about that package...

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:37.779
I told you I sent it to our house,

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:39.120
not the study.

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:43.719
I even bought facial masks for Auntie,

00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:45.219
so make sure you share them.

00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:47.319
- Bye. - All right, take care.

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.490
Okay, I get it. Stop nagging me.

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:52.460
Oh, that kid from that old sitcom.

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:54.660
I heard she's going to be on TV again.

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:56.429
Is she still as pretty?

00:34:56.430 --> 00:34:58.399
Oh, she was just gorgeous back then.

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.340
- How'd she turn out? - I have no idea.

00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:02.670
She probably didn't age well.

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:07.839
Is she going to start her own company?

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.510
- What was that? - What?

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:12.449
Oh, no, it's nothing. Just thinking out loud.

00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:13.549
What was it?

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:14.649
(Report Card)

00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:15.990
Gosh.

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.920
And here I thought I had a knack for teaching.

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:21.320
Good thing I didn't become a teacher.

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:30.870
While I'm gone, you make sure Nu Ri eats.

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.300
Where are you going?

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:33.740
To plant a tree.

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:35.970
Know what her grades are like before you go...

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:37.370
What are you, Spinoza now?

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.840
What's gotten into you?

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:45.820
Eun Nu Ri, tell me.

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:47.950
Do you know who Spinoza is or not?

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:56.530
I'm checking your report card as soon as I get back. Got it?

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:02.899
Hey, be careful with my suitcase.

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:05.639
I babied that thing, even on my school trip!

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.870
Taking your sister's suitcase... Should I just buy you one?

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:13.440
Hey, do you really not know? Or are you just messing with me?

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:15.810
Both?

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.389
A disposable camera? I haven't seen one of these in a while.

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:30.730
I've never used one before, so I'm curious.

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:35.999
Oh, right. You were the Gangnam princess.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.030
You probably only used fancy cameras.

00:36:38.570 --> 00:36:40.439
Her Royal Highness...

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.710
had her days as a princess.

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:44.609
- I'll take your picture. - Okay.

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:45.810
One, two...

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.209
- Oh, beautiful. - Thanks.

00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:49.410
One more.

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:50.880
One, two...

00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:52.320
You look so pretty.

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:54.720
Oh, great.

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:05.930
How are you feeling? Want some more motion sickness medicine?

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:08.130
Water?

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:11.400
No, I think I just need to sleep it off.

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:53.679
You should enjoy the ocean view, too.

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:55.679
Gosh, what a view!

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.680
This is the life!

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:00.849
The ocean!

00:38:00.850 --> 00:38:02.690
Hey, this breeze feels amazing!

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:06.519
How about you two act like friends and smile?

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:08.659
- Pretend we're close? - But I'm not friends with her.

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:10.330
Just pretend a little.

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:27.609
No, that's not it at all!

00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:30.009
You can't do this. This is seriously wrong.

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:31.549
No.

00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:33.549
They're acting like children. Seriously.

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:34.880
You all worked hard.

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:36.450
You must be cold.

00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:57.810
What? It's trash.

00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:00.240
- Want to do it together? - Yes, let's.

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:03.650
- Should we get a shot of that? - Oh, sure.

00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:06.850
- Hey, get over here! - Let's do it together!

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:09.419
Why is there so much trash?

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:10.990
There's so much trash.

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.260
People just throw it anywhere. Unbelievable.

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.230
"I've grown up a lot, haven't I?"

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:18.059
"I've heard that a lot."

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:19.929
"A quick glance. Look at this kid."

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:22.870
Was there a scene we shot in the water like this?

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.870
- You want me to say it like this? - Yes.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.240
This is how it's done.

00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:32.410
Right, you do it like this.

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:35.710
And then your line is, "Don't you recall? That morning..."

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:40.520
Gosh, this view is just...

00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:43.220
so beautiful.

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:47.689
Writer, there's more over here.

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:49.360
- Oh, thank you. - No problem.

00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:00.239
I mean, look at her. She's just filming.

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.800
She planned this whole thing, and now...

00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:05.109
Tae Rin, you tired?

00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:06.110
Goodness.

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:08.480
You want me to do something about it?

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:10.410
No, I'm not tired at all.

00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:13.320
Practising how to shovel really paid off, right?

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:16.690
Well, as long as you're happy...

00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:20.320
Can anyone here drive a truck?

00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:22.959
Oh, I can!

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:25.459
I even almost drifted a van once.

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:26.460
I can.

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:29.130
Ten years with no accidents.

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:32.470
I'm a professional driver.

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:50.089
What's all this?

00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:52.290
If I don't go, who's going to move the equipment?

00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:55.160
I said I'll move it.

00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:57.759
They say a lot of deer show up around here.

00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.800
- Aren't you worried? - I told you, I'm strong.

00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:02.530
What?

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.430
Don't dare get in.

00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:16.810
Again.

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:18.680
Starting the engine.

00:41:22.650 --> 00:41:23.850
I'm going to make this work.

00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:25.290
One more time.

00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:29.020
No, put it in second...

00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:32.830
Move. Let me do it.

00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:36.729
One more time.

00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:39.270
The sun's going down. Are you trying to hold up the shoot?

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:43.840
All right, let's see what you've got.

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:01.790
Let me guess how you're feeling.

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:03.390
Pick one.

00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:05.160
One, you're sulking.

00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:06.600
Two, you're pouting.

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:08.929
- What do you mean? - There are four choices.

00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:10.569
Three, you're peeved.

00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:12.739
- Four... - Oh, forget it.

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:14.069
Just put me down for number two.

00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:15.910
And stop coming up with pointless options.

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:18.569
So you are pouting.

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:20.610
No, I'm telling you, I'm not.

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:41.000
Speaking of Writer Jin Mu Yeong.

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:44.430
Has he given up on writing for good?

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:46.970
He's a really entertaining writer.

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:49.570
Entertaining?

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:53.380
It went out of print after the first run.

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:55.039
Hey, come on.

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:56.809
Someone says she enjoyed his work,

00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:59.280
and you have to shut her down like that?

00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:02.279
I knew it. You are sulking.

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:04.120
I told you, I'm not. Seriously.

00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:07.790
I said "pouting."

00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:11.390
Right.

00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:17.570
See you tomorrow.

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:18.800
Good work.

00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:22.470
Okay, I'll pass that along. Yes.

00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:26.340
Oh, yes, understood. Okay.

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:29.280
- Tae Rin. - Yes?

00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:33.220
We got the script revisions.

00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:34.980
Again?

00:43:35.350 --> 00:43:36.790
How many?

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:38.520
Three.

00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:41.359
Well, since you're so good at memorizing your lines,

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:43.930
I guess they trust you, so they keep sending more revisions.

00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:48.260
All right! For tonight's wrap party, we're having pork belly!

00:43:56.970 --> 00:43:58.309
You can't have any, right?

00:43:58.310 --> 00:44:01.610
My character is gaunt from sorrow. I can't be glowing from pork.

00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:04.510
I'll just memorize my lines, I guess.

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:14.790
Thanks.

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:22.730
Yes?

00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:31.510
What are you doing?

00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:33.680
Open up.

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:36.880
I can't.

00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:46.020
Open up.

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:01.240
No.

00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:04.869
I have to show some solidarity with Tae Rin.

00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:06.580
Just say I'm being petty.

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:08.780
Bye.

00:45:16.090 --> 00:45:17.290
So good.

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:51.420
(Mo Tae Rin)

00:45:58.990 --> 00:46:00.100
Such a pro.

00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:03.130
What do you get when a flower shop catches on fire?

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:04.600
Fireworks.

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:07.600
You have a weird sense of humour.

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:24.720
The sea is nice.

00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:29.360
Is there a water deer?

00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:32.390
At the beach?

00:46:38.370 --> 00:46:39.370
Excuse me.

00:46:39.970 --> 00:46:40.970
Are you okay?

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:46.110
Sung Je Yeon.

00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:50.310
Stay back.

00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:53.279
Pretend you didn't see me. Just go.

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:55.020
I didn't see you fall.

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:56.720
Get up.

00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:03.930
Do you like the ocean?

00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:08.160
I'm not sure.

00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:11.470
I was born by the ocean, that's all.

00:47:11.570 --> 00:47:13.099
You were born by the ocean?

00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:14.740
Is that really so surprising?

00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:16.170
No.

00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:20.140
I just didn't know.

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:21.840
What about you?

00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:23.680
Do you still like the ocean?

00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:26.150
Well...

00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:29.250
I like it all.

00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:31.720
Mountains, the ocean, open fields...

00:47:35.090 --> 00:47:36.390
It's really nice here.

00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:38.160
Right?

00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:41.400
You just don't get this feeling in the city.

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:43.700
Tell me about it.

00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:00.280
What? Where did the other one go?

00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:02.849
You had two bracelets, didn't you?

00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:03.850
What?

00:48:04.850 --> 00:48:05.950
Oh, you're right.

00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:07.859
When did this break?

00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:10.290
I guess this means you're going to get rich. Seriously.

00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:11.830
You remember.

00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:21.370
Of course, I do.

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:29.610
It's how I recognised you.

00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:31.380
I see.

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:34.320
It held up...

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:36.390
for a really long time.

00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:46.400
Sung Je Yeon.

00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:49.800
Are things still awkward between us?

00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:54.400
We're going to be stuck together for this whole shoot.

00:48:56.070 --> 00:48:58.640
Just when I think I'm over it, I feel guilty again.

00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:01.540
Like I dragged you into this mess for nothing.

00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:13.390
Starting right now, just let it go.

00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:15.790
It's a useless expression.

00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:18.530
And don't trip again.

00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:22.859
Don't you sleep well.

00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:24.299
Gosh!

00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:25.330
Hey!

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:29.640
Do you have a death wish?

00:49:32.170 --> 00:49:33.180
Good night.

00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:39.850
What's so funny?

00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:56.899
- What the... A snake! - What?

00:49:56.900 --> 00:49:58.969
Hey, Tae Rin, get back!

00:49:58.970 --> 00:50:01.240
Get up on something, okay? It's a snake.

00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:03.039
There's nothing to get on.

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:04.710
Then get in the car.

00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:09.709
Hey!

00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:11.580
- Want some? - Sure.

00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:13.980
- This will wake you up. - Thanks.

00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:17.020
They weren't kidding when they said there were snakes out here.

00:50:17.850 --> 00:50:20.219
Where's the snake?

00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:22.659
- Oh, my gosh, stay back! - Stay back.

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:24.589
- Right here. - Gosh, it's real.

00:50:24.590 --> 00:50:26.999
Wait, am I the only one freaking out?

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.559
They told us yesterday in the fields...

00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:30.030
that we'd be fine if we stayed still.

00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:32.570
Guess you weren't paying attention.

00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:35.099
It's dangerous.

00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:36.670
You're an actress. You need to be careful.

00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:38.840
A snake? Where? Where is it?

00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:42.009
Where's the camera? Get a camera.

00:50:42.010 --> 00:50:43.579
- Let's go, quick! - This way. Over here.

00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:44.710
It bites. Be careful.

00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:46.749
Snake!

00:50:46.750 --> 00:50:48.680
She's completely changed.

00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:51.249
- He got bit? - Yes.

00:50:51.250 --> 00:50:52.850
And apparently, the only thing here is a public health center.

00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:55.860
I should get on the earliest boat and go with him.

00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:57.560
Yes, okay.

00:50:57.930 --> 00:51:00.800
I'll take care of the receipts, so just have a safe trip.

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:03.269
I really shouldn't be asking you to do this.

00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:04.469
- Thank you. - Oh, don't mention it.

00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:05.969
Who do you people think you are?

00:51:05.970 --> 00:51:08.400
Who gave you permission to film here?

00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:10.410
Hello, sir.

00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:12.369
I hope we weren't being too loud.

00:51:12.370 --> 00:51:15.010
What gives you the right to film without my permission?

00:51:15.610 --> 00:51:18.280
Typical. You TV people are all the same.

00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:21.450
Look, I only agreed because they said they'd plant trees.

00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:23.349
I never said you could film.

00:51:23.350 --> 00:51:24.649
Right, so...

00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:26.889
Well, if you could give us a moment to explain...

00:51:26.890 --> 00:51:29.219
Look, I'm telling you, no one told me anything about this.

00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:31.260
- We're really almost done... - No.

00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:33.959
- Go over there and smooth it over. - Me?

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:36.569
- Just go and beg him. Hurry! - Why? What are you telling me?

00:51:36.570 --> 00:51:38.270
Oh, come on, sir.

00:51:39.130 --> 00:51:40.140
What's he saying?

00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:43.040
He's really not budging.

00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:47.239
He says planting is fine, but absolutely no filming.

00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:49.740
What? So we just have to leave?

00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:53.620
Forget the trees. Let's just pack up.

00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:56.490
If we miss the boat, our schedule's a mess. Let's move out!

00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:57.990
Let's move!

00:51:57.991 --> 00:52:00.120
If you're just going to leave them,

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:03.260
could I stay behind and plant them?

00:52:04.690 --> 00:52:07.829
If they're planted correctly, these guys will grow just fine.

00:52:07.830 --> 00:52:08.930
By yourself?

00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:12.569
Come on, that was a job for us all. How can you do it alone?

00:52:12.570 --> 00:52:14.739
Besides, we don't have a place to stay as of tonight.

00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:16.939
I'll be fine. I can sleep anywhere.

00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:18.270
Please, don't worry about me.

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:20.280
You all should get going, then.

00:52:21.210 --> 00:52:22.309
Thanks for your hard work.

00:52:22.310 --> 00:52:23.780
- Great work. - You too.

00:52:24.810 --> 00:52:26.079
- I'm off. - Good luck.

00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:27.780
All right, then. Good luck.

00:52:28.350 --> 00:52:29.989
Pack it up! Let's move, people!

00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:31.519
Okay, great work, everyone.

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:33.360
- Good work. - You too.

00:52:36.290 --> 00:52:38.159
Hey, hurry up. Let's go.

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:39.260
I'll wrap things up here.

00:52:39.730 --> 00:52:42.030
I'll leave it in your hands. Thanks.

00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:47.040
Man, what a shame.

00:52:48.670 --> 00:52:51.339
Yes, I've got all the receipts.

00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:54.440
I'm about to get on the boat now, too. Yes.

00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:57.910
Okay, I'll see you next time. Bye.

00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:05.019
Hi. A ticket for 4pm, please.

00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:07.860
Oh, dear. All afternoon ferries have been cancelled.

00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:10.760
The boats can't leave because of the bad weather.

00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:12.860
What?

00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:15.429
But it's perfectly clear out.

00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:16.829
For now, it is.

00:53:16.830 --> 00:53:18.830
Anyway, you have to take the ferry tomorrow.

00:53:34.250 --> 00:53:36.020
Hey, it's me. Well...

00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:39.620
Mind if I give you a hand?

00:53:44.590 --> 00:53:46.130
Isn't it hard doing this all by yourself?

00:53:46.730 --> 00:53:48.630
Hey, here, let me. I'll do it.

00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:51.770
You should save your strength.

00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:54.769
We have to get an early start on planting tomorrow.

00:53:54.770 --> 00:53:55.770
I see.

00:53:56.970 --> 00:53:58.310
Must be an island thing.

00:53:59.070 --> 00:54:00.510
The rain comes and goes all day here.

00:54:01.810 --> 00:54:03.109
Tell me about it.

00:54:03.110 --> 00:54:05.380
You never know with the weather, seriously.

00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:11.449
(University Hospital)

00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:13.460
Oh, right. My blood test.

00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:14.760
Blood test?

00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:17.490
- For a checkup? - It's just a routine thing.

00:54:18.130 --> 00:54:20.260
It was for tomorrow morning, but I can't make it now.

00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:23.970
Oh, here.

00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:26.399
I guess we're getting old.

00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:27.970
We're falling apart.

00:54:28.970 --> 00:54:29.970
To be honest,

00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:32.970
I was wondering how I'd ever get this all planted by myself.

00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:35.980
I'm glad it worked out this way.

00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:48.420
If they only have one room here, too,

00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:50.530
I'll just go sleep at the other inn.

00:54:51.530 --> 00:54:52.530
Okay.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.260
We've only got one room left.

00:54:56.800 --> 00:55:00.240
We are not in a situation that calls for one room.

00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:03.610
Two. Please give us two.

00:55:03.970 --> 00:55:06.069
I'm serious. Ferries were cancelled out of nowhere.

00:55:06.070 --> 00:55:07.640
Everywhere else around here is probably booked solid.

00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:10.410
You take the room.

00:55:11.110 --> 00:55:12.280
We'll take the room.

00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:14.980
Hello?

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:18.350
Oh, hi. I'm the one who was just there ten minutes ago.

00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:20.690
Oh, yes.

00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:23.119
The handsome young man from Seoul. Yes.

00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:24.160
Yes, that's me.

00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:28.660
You said you had one room left, right?

00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:32.030
I see.

00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:34.540
Right. I understand.

00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:35.800
Thank you.

00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:41.840
You worked hard today. It's late.

00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:43.710
You should go get some rest, too.

00:55:52.590 --> 00:55:53.820
Don't tell me...

00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:57.160
The room...

00:55:57.830 --> 00:55:59.260
It's not gone, is it?

00:56:10.270 --> 00:56:11.870
So, you want to sleep in the car?

00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:16.480
Rock-paper-scissors for it?

00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:18.609
- One and done? - Yes.

00:56:18.610 --> 00:56:19.850
Rock-paper-scissors!

00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:23.180
Best 2 out of 3. Rock-paper-scissors!

00:56:25.050 --> 00:56:26.920
Guess I'm sleeping in the car, then.

00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:29.420
I do feel a little bad about it, but...

00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:40.770
You...

00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:43.070
could always sleep in the car.

00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:44.340
And why would I do that?

00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:54.619
Well, good work today.

00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:57.450
I look forward to another productive day tomorrow.

00:56:58.090 --> 00:57:00.920
You're being awfully formal for a couple of roommates.

00:57:04.330 --> 00:57:05.560
Sorry, it's a habit.

00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:08.099
Hey, did you by any chance...

00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:09.600
finish my book?

00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:13.500
Someone's curious if I liked it.

00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:15.800
Fine.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.610
I've been reading it ever since you mentioned it yesterday.

00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:23.340
It was surprisingly hopeful.

00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:25.180
I guess that's how you want to live?

00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:27.980
I asked if you liked it.

00:57:28.450 --> 00:57:29.620
Gosh.

00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:33.660
I hate to give you the satisfaction,

00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:37.290
but it was actually pretty funny.

00:57:38.090 --> 00:57:39.530
I also felt a certain...

00:57:40.090 --> 00:57:42.560
sense of kinship, I guess.

00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:45.600
I mean, my 20s were sort of like that too.

00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:48.439
How so?

00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:50.339
Just for taking a semester off school,

00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:52.470
my entire family jumped on me,

00:57:53.310 --> 00:57:56.140
yelling, cajoling, and scolding me.

00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:59.480
They said I was having a late teenage rebellion.

00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:03.320
Our family was united, even more then when it went bankrupt.

00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:05.589
When you were a high school senior,

00:58:05.590 --> 00:58:07.689
you'd study so hard, even sacrificing sleep.

00:58:07.690 --> 00:58:10.190
But I ended up quitting.

00:58:11.130 --> 00:58:13.530
Turns out I'm just the type who likes to take risks.

00:58:20.970 --> 00:58:22.870
The funny thing about this business is,

00:58:23.570 --> 00:58:27.310
a low-budget film you slaved away on can be a huge hit,

00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:31.080
or you can pour big money into one, and it'll totally flop.

00:58:32.310 --> 00:58:34.320
You can never really predict the outcome.

00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:37.850
So why do we keep at it?

00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:44.960
Maybe I should just quit and take another risk.

00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:52.430
The relationships you build?

00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:57.310
The time you spend together, things like that?

00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:08.020
I've never been on a set like this before.

00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:11.350
Where someone actually listens to me...

00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:13.620
and asks me...

00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:15.620
if I'm doing okay.

00:59:18.030 --> 00:59:19.330
Should we just sleep together?

00:59:31.370 --> 00:59:32.840
We're just going to hold hands and sleep, right?

00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:34.980
Yes.

00:59:37.450 --> 00:59:39.180
What? No.

00:59:40.750 --> 00:59:41.880
No.

00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:43.720
The bed...

00:59:45.290 --> 00:59:46.720
There's still only one.

00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:47.960
Should I...

00:59:48.790 --> 00:59:50.390
take the bed?

00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:52.490
You think asking politely makes it okay?

00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:55.760
To be fair,

00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:58.070
want to share?

00:59:58.730 --> 00:59:59.730
What?

01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:06.910
See, that's the kind of thing you're supposed to ask politely.

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:10.610
Gosh, I'm so exhausted I can barely keep my eyes open.

01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:12.680
Lights out.

01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:24.760
Oh, right.

01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:27.260
They're not here.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.230
Yes, they are.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.670
I'm right here, breathing and everything.

01:00:33.770 --> 01:00:35.540
Are you really going to pretend I'm not here?

01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:40.010
Oh yes, you are.

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:44.380
This feels so weird.

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:48.420
You're not getting any funny ideas, are you?

01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:50.450
I'm not.

01:00:57.860 --> 01:00:58.930
Why not?

01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:02.499
So should I or shouldn't I?

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:03.500
Whatever.

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:05.330
Just forget it. Don't.

01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:14.179
You know, back then...

01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:15.210
you really...

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.050
sparkled.

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:23.680
And...

01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:41.440
Good night.

01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:05.160
"Sparkled." Past tense.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:12.230
I guess I don't anymore.

01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:03.020
He's gone?

01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:06.590
Oh, it must've been a dream.

01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:08.620
Oh, thank goodness.

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:14.360
Hey, I'm right here.

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:16.060
Want me to disappear?

01:03:18.930 --> 01:03:20.070
Such a relief.

01:03:20.670 --> 01:03:22.040
It was a dream.

01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:41.590
Gosh, you're really something else.

01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:44.160
So this is why you run a flower shop.

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:47.329
I mean, the smell of the earth...

01:03:47.330 --> 01:03:49.360
And it clears your head of all the clutter.

01:03:50.330 --> 01:03:52.469
And the sounds... Gosh.

01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:53.899
I've only ever heard them on an app.

01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:56.140
It's so much better in person.

01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:00.540
Oh, by the way,

01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:02.340
the cactus...

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:03.980
Is it doing all right?

01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:07.520
Hey, why do you keep assuming I killed it?

01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:09.050
Because you seem like the type who would.

01:04:09.650 --> 01:04:11.190
Just to get back at me.

01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:13.490
You know, maybe I will.

01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:15.460
- What? - Not the cactus.

01:04:16.490 --> 01:04:17.990
You want to die? Seriously?

01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:20.390
You came all the way from the mainland, just like that?

01:04:21.930 --> 01:04:22.930
Gosh...

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:26.029
Why would you even bring a car to an island in the first place?

01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:27.439
You're so unprepared.

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:30.469
The producer said they'd cover all car-related expenses.

01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:32.170
I guess they forgot and just took off.

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:36.540
Why is there no service?

01:04:38.110 --> 01:04:39.310
Call insurance first.

01:04:40.550 --> 01:04:41.880
- Hang on. - Gosh.

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:46.390
(Gas station, when you're out of gas)

01:04:47.090 --> 01:04:49.889
If we go to catch the ferry, it'll be cancelled due to the weather.

01:04:49.890 --> 01:04:51.990
And then we'll be trapped on the island! Again!

01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:53.530
And there will only be one room.

01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:56.429
You know how dramas always have these contrived scenes?

01:04:56.430 --> 01:04:59.069
Oh, so this is contrived.

01:04:59.070 --> 01:05:00.639
In the drama Tae Rin's in now,

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:02.739
a perfectly good car suddenly breaks down.

01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:05.369
Why? Because the plot needs it to.

01:05:05.370 --> 01:05:07.580
What are you even looking at?

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:09.640
What is it?

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:11.510
"Gas station?"

01:05:12.650 --> 01:05:13.910
"When you're out of gas?"

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:21.790
I found it.

01:05:22.090 --> 01:05:23.290
It says there's a gas station nearby.

01:05:24.090 --> 01:05:25.190
I'll go get some gas.

01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:28.330
Hey.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.699
Hey, no, wait.

01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:33.799
I got a public safety alert earlier about wild boars in this area.

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:36.040
What if I run into one while I'm all alone?

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:38.510
Hey, that's an even more contrived plot point.

01:05:39.070 --> 01:05:42.939
Are you avoiding insurance because you're worried about your rates?

01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:43.940
No.

01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:46.349
This area is outside their service zone.

01:05:46.350 --> 01:05:47.350
Give it here.

01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:51.049
Why are you just telling me that now?

01:05:51.050 --> 01:05:52.450
Gosh!

01:05:55.490 --> 01:05:59.230
I'm the kind of person who always follows the map.

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:03.000
The ferry's been cancelled, and now the car's broken down.

01:06:04.530 --> 01:06:06.700
What about you? Have you always lived like that?

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:08.400
Following the map?

01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:10.940
What?

01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:12.940
I mean...

01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:18.010
Have you ever had to follow a map you've never seen before?

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:21.550
Well...

01:06:23.650 --> 01:06:25.950
Even when I wasn't sure it was the right path,

01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:28.920
there were many times I had to keep going.

01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:31.130
Like right now?

01:06:32.130 --> 01:06:33.130
Oh, that's right.

01:06:33.730 --> 01:06:35.400
You said you liked adventures.

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:39.970
- Gosh. - What?

01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:42.570
I've been looking forward to this since we got here on location.

01:06:43.370 --> 01:06:44.370
To what?

01:06:45.070 --> 01:06:46.470
Planting a tree.

01:06:47.070 --> 01:06:49.139
I mean, when else would I get the chance?

01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:51.049
If we just plant it carefully,

01:06:51.050 --> 01:06:54.050
I bet it would grow up all nice and straight.

01:06:56.720 --> 01:07:00.220
For it to grow big enough to be impressive...

01:07:01.090 --> 01:07:02.690
About five years, I guess?

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:06.329
It'll be so beautiful when it blossoms.

01:07:06.330 --> 01:07:07.400
What's the flower's meaning?

01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:09.500
Not telling you.

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:10.630
Gosh.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.940
- Hey, Sunwoo Hae. - Yes?

01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:19.439
Seriously,

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:21.310
why did you agree to do this show?

01:07:28.750 --> 01:07:30.950
You're still wondering about that?

01:07:31.790 --> 01:07:34.289
You've turned down every other offer until now.

01:07:34.290 --> 01:07:35.690
And I totally get why.

01:07:36.290 --> 01:07:38.389
But the fact that you accepted this one?

01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:41.300
I just can't seem to wrap my head around it.

01:07:42.730 --> 01:07:44.900
"A heart that yearns..."

01:07:46.370 --> 01:07:47.570
"for a friend, now parted."

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:53.339
My, your feelings are so...

01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:54.640
admirable.

01:07:57.710 --> 01:07:58.750
The meaning...

01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:03.180
of the flower of the tree we planted.

01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:07.620
What? When did you look that up?

01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:09.319
You didn't have a chance to.

01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:10.490
I made it up. So what?

01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:18.500
Listen to Mr. Wordsmith over here.

01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:55.870
Hey, you're about to touch me.

01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:59.510
You're going to touch me! Hey!

01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:01.940
You touched me!

01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:05.610
Gosh, you're such a handful.

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:08.720
Relax, I'm not going to bite.

01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:24.700
If you don't like it, pull away.

01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:27.100
And if I do?

01:09:29.870 --> 01:09:31.040
Then I'm in luck.

01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:50.420
(My Youth)

01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:51.920
What happens to us now?

01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:54.960
We kissed, so we can't go back to how we were.

01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:56.889
What have I just done?

01:10:56.890 --> 01:10:59.330
It'll be more awkward if we stay quiet.

01:10:59.430 --> 01:11:03.130
The 19-year-old you was like a protruding stone.

01:11:03.530 --> 01:11:06.200
You rose up and tripped me up anytime.

01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:08.370
The original publisher went bankrupt.

01:11:08.770 --> 01:11:09.899
The original's out of print,

01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:12.340
and the contract just says "original artist."

01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:15.540
Come back? You never came back after what happened to his mother!

01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:18.209
Can I go on a date here?

01:11:18.210 --> 01:11:19.310
With whom?

01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:20.910
Someone I like.

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:23.780
Being curious about what they're doing is the beginning.

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:27.550
Isn't it nice when someone who dumped you clings to you?

01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:31.260
Do you want to go out with me if you're not seeing anyone?
