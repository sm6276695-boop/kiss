00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:18.936
TEMPEST

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:33.700
We couldn't stop this war after all.

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:42.167
For one last time…

00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:47.506
I want you to pretend…

00:00:54.096 --> 00:00:55.806
this is just an ordinary day.

00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:26.628
If this were just an ordinary day…

00:01:28.714 --> 00:01:31.258
and we were just
an ordinary man and woman…

00:01:34.678 --> 00:01:36.471
I would be asking you…

00:01:40.183 --> 00:01:41.893
"Who are you really?

00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:45.689
Why did you come to me?

00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:51.695
Would you really

00:01:52.654 --> 00:01:54.406
take a bullet for me?

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:05.625
And why…

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:08.503
Why do I see you in my dreams?"

00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:02.599
I've never been
afraid of anything…

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:07.813
until I felt the fear…

00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:11.817
of something happening to you.

00:03:27.082 --> 00:03:28.834
I was scared you'd get hurt

00:03:29.543 --> 00:03:31.169
and I wouldn't be there in time.

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:37.092
That's why, even in my dreams,
I held on to you.

00:03:38.844 --> 00:03:40.887
I was afraid I'd lose you there too,

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:43.974
when I had nothing left in this world.

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:02.534
Honestly, I really
don't care about the war.

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:07.205
I only want to run away with you, Munju.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.877
Let's go.

00:04:14.296 --> 00:04:15.464
You mean that?

00:04:16.465 --> 00:04:17.591
I mean it.

00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:19.926
Let's escape together.

00:05:11.937 --> 00:05:13.980
Where were you thinking of taking us?

00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:22.197
How about the Gobi Desert?

00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:25.408
The Gobi Desert?

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:34.584
I spent two years there, after defecting.

00:05:48.557 --> 00:05:50.392
I had a lot I needed to forget.

00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:56.064
My father, my mother, and my grandmother
who told me to never return.

00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:59.192
I looked at the stars moving slowly.

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:02.737
And, as always,
one star remained unchanged.

00:06:06.575 --> 00:06:07.868
Polaris.

00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:14.499
Whenever I looked up at the sky,

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:18.128
it felt like nothing else existed,
just me and that star.

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:22.883
It didn't matter that I had
no family, no homeland.

00:06:27.012 --> 00:06:29.180
I felt like I could go anywhere I wanted.

00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:33.226
Could I join you there?

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:38.398
Do you have something
that you wanna forget?

00:06:41.318 --> 00:06:42.777
My Mother's hands.

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:53.121
Rough and worn, from years of working
at the grocery store,

00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:55.040
a factory, and a nail salon.

00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:01.713
She'd come home exhausted
and immediately collapse into bed.

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:13.808
I wanted to protect those hands.

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:18.229
In the end, I failed to do that.

00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:20.690
So that's why you came to Korea?

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:25.070
After my dad died,

00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:28.406
my mother ran as far as she could
and ended up in the States.

00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:34.621
I thought that we all belong to a country,

00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:36.748
the way we all have a mother.

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:40.126
And for me, that country was Korea.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.755
That's why I thought it was important

00:07:43.838 --> 00:07:46.549
that I eventually came back
to serve in office.

00:07:52.597 --> 00:07:55.141
That's why you wanted
so badly to stop the war?

00:07:58.436 --> 00:08:01.606
As much as I wanted
to protect my mom's hands.

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:07.779
And once again, I failed.

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:21.042
Brimming with
the hopes of this great people's republic,

00:08:21.126 --> 00:08:25.088
the newest nuclear submarine
has been revealed in all its splendor

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:28.258
in time for tomorrow's
historic launching ceremony.

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:29.884
The nuclear submarine,

00:08:29.968 --> 00:08:33.805
which for decades had been a symbol of
aggression against our republic,

00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:37.142
has now come to symbolize
the power of our people,

00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:40.478
- that speaks directly to the hearts…
- That's the submarine we're trying to hit?

00:08:40.562 --> 00:08:44.190
- That's the submarine we're trying to hit?
- This is a momentous and joyful event.

00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:48.403
Jesus Christ.

00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:53.033
It's an entirely different vessel
from what we'd anticipated.

00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:56.327
This submarine is a 3,000-ton
Romeo class model,

00:08:56.411 --> 00:08:58.621
heavily modified
from an old Russian design.

00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:01.624
That hull won't be able to withstand
the pressure of a missile launch.

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:04.919
They've installed the missile deck
behind the bridge for no obvious reason.

00:09:05.003 --> 00:09:08.923
From a design perspective, this submarine
offers no functional effectiveness.

00:09:13.428 --> 00:09:16.848
Late last night, a reckless U.S.
reconnaissance airplane

00:09:16.931 --> 00:09:19.559
trespassing in our territory
was shot down.

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:21.227
Let this be a warning.

00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:25.398
We are a nuclear-armed state, and our
military does not make empty threats.

00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:28.985
The kind of world you wake up to
tomorrow is up to you.

00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:32.822
That Anderson video
is spreading like wildfire.

00:09:33.448 --> 00:09:35.325
Are you really going to
start a war over a submarine?

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:39.162
We'll look into the submarine,
but that's not what's important right now.

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:43.666
This war is a struggle between
democracy and despotism.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.795
So if we back down now,
we are surrendering our future

00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:49.756
to this string of dictatorships
from China to Russia to Idisha,

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:51.049
all the way to North Korea.

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:57.472
I'm afraid we have
a little problem, Madam President.

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:00.600
Indeed, Mr. President.

00:10:01.684 --> 00:10:03.603
In the present situation,

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:07.107
it would be difficult for me
to persuade our people

00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:10.068
to endure the sacrifice of war.

00:10:10.652 --> 00:10:12.612
Let's set aside the recon jet incident.

00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:14.489
The timing wasn't right
for us to retaliate.

00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:15.740
We'll find another way.

00:10:15.824 --> 00:10:18.660
As I've mentioned before,
this is our last chance.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.995
If we lose this opportunity,

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:23.414
the free world will be in peril.

00:10:24.124 --> 00:10:26.126
I'm going to do everything
I can from over here,

00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:28.962
but I'll also need you
to do something for me.

00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:32.132
Seo Munju, your former ambassador.

00:10:33.007 --> 00:10:35.635
She has been, uh, quite a nuisance.

00:10:36.594 --> 00:10:38.388
I'd thank you to take care of her.

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:45.228
At 11:51 p.m. last night,

00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:49.649
a U.S. reconnaissance aircraft
on a routine mission

00:10:49.732 --> 00:10:51.985
to survey the Korean peninsula,

00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:56.281
was shot down when North Korean ground
forces launched a surface-to-air missile.

00:10:56.364 --> 00:11:00.743
In response, our military had issued
a Level Two defense alert,

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:04.956
and the CFC has now elevated
WATCHCON to its second highest level.

00:11:05.039 --> 00:11:08.334
In prompt response,
the Civil Defense Alert Control Center

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:11.171
issued a preliminary warning,
which has now been lifted.

00:11:11.713 --> 00:11:15.550
Our government and military remain
unwavering in our steadfast commitment

00:11:15.633 --> 00:11:20.471
to protecting the lives and safety of
our people under any circumstances.

00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:25.393
We ask all citizens to stand firm with
the same courage and unwavering trust,

00:11:25.476 --> 00:11:27.604
and to return to their daily lives.

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:29.606
In times of crisis like this…

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:32.358
- Luckily, the true crisis was averted.
- …national unity matters the most…

00:11:32.442 --> 00:11:35.195
- So it wasn't a complete failure.
- …and we must protect one another.

00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:39.699
- Yeah, but this is just the beginning.
- The Republic of Korea

00:11:39.782 --> 00:11:44.621
will neither retreat nor falter,
no matter the circumstances.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.874
Seo Munju,
your former ambassador.

00:11:48.666 --> 00:11:51.294
She has been, uh, quite a nuisance.

00:11:52.295 --> 00:11:54.130
I'd thank you to take care of her.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.385
I understand, Mr. President.

00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:03.556
She will no longer be an issue.

00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:08.061
{\an8}PRESIDENT CHAE URGES CITIZENS
TO RETURN TO DAILY LIFE

00:12:09.354 --> 00:12:11.773
President Chae still has serious concerns.

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:14.400
None of this is over yet.

00:12:15.693 --> 00:12:17.237
PRESIDENTIAL REPORT

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.780
WAR IMMINENT
ON KOREAN PENINSULA?

00:12:18.863 --> 00:12:20.156
TENSIONS MOUNT, IS WAR NEXT?

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.076
The media responses to your speech, ma'am.

00:12:23.618 --> 00:12:25.370
NO TRUST IN KOREAN
OR US PRESIDENT

00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:26.579
{\an8}SEO MUNJU DEEMED TRUSTWORTHY

00:12:26.663 --> 00:12:28.039
{\an8}IF NOT FOR HER,
WAR WOULD'VE ERUPTED

00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.376
SEO'S STATEMENT DRAWS ATTENTION…

00:12:31.459 --> 00:12:32.919
IS SHE THE ONLY VOICE
PEOPLE TRUST?

00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:39.175
They're mostly saying we can't be trusted.

00:12:40.218 --> 00:12:42.637
And Seo Munju became their Joan of Arc.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.764
North Korea unveiling that submarine,

00:12:44.847 --> 00:12:47.225
is now proof that
Anderson's claims were true.

00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:51.145
So now the people seem to believe
that averting war was Munju's doing.

00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:54.774
If we run a poll now,
her ratings would be off the charts.

00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:58.528
In all your years in politics,

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:00.947
have you ever had to manage
a crisis as bad as this?

00:13:02.365 --> 00:13:03.449
No, I have not, ma'am.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:05.743
It's tricky, isn't it?

00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:08.204
Even with the support of
the entire nation,

00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:10.248
this would be difficult to navigate.

00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:11.624
And yet,

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:15.420
Munju has turned public opinion
against me, hasn't she?

00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:17.005
Should I accept that from her?

00:13:19.007 --> 00:13:20.466
Absolutely not.

00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:28.099
War starts with public opinion.

00:13:29.017 --> 00:13:31.477
To win a war against North Korea,
Madam President,

00:13:32.103 --> 00:13:34.522
Seo Munju is the first of many obstacles.

00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:38.234
We have prepared for this situation
for some time now.

00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:41.029
You say there are plans.

00:13:42.321 --> 00:13:44.323
For Munju, is that what you mean?

00:13:44.407 --> 00:13:46.743
If you give me some time, I can explain.

00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:51.247
It's been ten minutes.

00:14:10.141 --> 00:14:12.894
{\an8}Today the President made
a public statement

00:14:12.977 --> 00:14:16.314
{\an8}regarding North Korea's downing of
an American aircraft.

00:14:16.397 --> 00:14:18.274
President Chae stated that…

00:14:18.357 --> 00:14:21.235
…the nationwide warning issued last night
has now been lifted.

00:14:21.319 --> 00:14:25.323
She also assured that the government
and military will stand firm,

00:14:25.406 --> 00:14:28.034
and uphold their duty to protect
the safety of the citizens

00:14:28.117 --> 00:14:29.952
under any circumstances…

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:34.165
Miji?

00:14:34.248 --> 00:14:36.834
Ms. Seo, Changhee is finally awake.

00:14:36.918 --> 00:14:38.336
He's okay?

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.296
Changhee, how are you doing?

00:14:40.963 --> 00:14:43.382
They released him from
the ICU to a private suite.

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:46.677
Luckily, they fixed
the internal bleeding in surgery.

00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:48.387
Seriously, I'm fine.

00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:49.472
Listen,

00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:52.100
there's something you need to know.

00:14:53.267 --> 00:14:55.019
On that morning

00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:57.605
when the password was finally cracked,

00:14:58.106 --> 00:15:01.234
I unlocked the phone thinking that I'd
finally gotten in to his secure emails,

00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:02.568
but instead…

00:15:03.194 --> 00:15:04.445
Yes!

00:15:07.698 --> 00:15:10.618
{\an8}I noticed unread messages on his Telegram.

00:15:11.744 --> 00:15:12.745
SEP 7

00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:14.288
INCOMING CALL 11 P.M. TOMORROW

00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:22.338
Now, we award the highest honor given

00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:24.882
in the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea,

00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:27.343
- The Order of Kim Il Sung!
- This is the state's founding anniversary.

00:15:27.426 --> 00:15:29.262
{\an8}"77TH FOUNDING
ANNIVERSARY OF DPRK"

00:15:29.345 --> 00:15:30.888
{\an8}Comrade Jang Junik!

00:15:40.857 --> 00:15:45.027
Comrade Jang Junik has devoted his life
to stopping the vile and treacherous war

00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:48.990
by the traitors and imperialists,
and to reunifying our nation.

00:15:49.073 --> 00:15:53.995
He leaves behind a most heroic legacy,
that will go down in our history.

00:15:54.078 --> 00:15:58.624
Though today we are unable to pin
this medal on your uniform,

00:15:58.708 --> 00:16:00.585
when the day of reunification comes,

00:16:00.668 --> 00:16:03.504
you shall return without hesitation
to claim this great honor.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:10.845
He really was a spy.

00:16:12.305 --> 00:16:14.015
I just couldn't believe it was true.

00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:17.143
So I tried to find out
who sent the message to him.

00:16:17.727 --> 00:16:20.938
This is Assemblyman Jang Junik's
chief secretary, Park Changhee.

00:16:21.022 --> 00:16:24.108
He confided in me that
he had intentions to prevent the war.

00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:25.359
Could we meet?

00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:31.073
BAENGNYEONSAN BOOKSTORE,
SEOMGWANGRO 24

00:16:31.157 --> 00:16:32.366
HYORIM-DONG,
SEODAEMUN-GU, AT 10:00

00:16:36.704 --> 00:16:38.206
To meet at Hyorim-dong,

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.334
you'd pass through
Seomgwang Tunnel, right?

00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:44.420
They must have ambushed him there.

00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:50.009
We were in Hyorim-dong that day
at Kang Hanna's house.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:51.969
Kang Hanna?

00:16:52.637 --> 00:16:53.638
Well, who's that?

00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:57.433
- Look at these, Grandma!
- Oh!

00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:01.562
Oh! Let me see.

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:04.565
I've pictured this moment, Mother.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.903
- That's so pretty.
- Ever since the moment I met Junik.

00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:12.698
- I dreamed of living in this house.
- How lovely!

00:17:14.283 --> 00:17:16.285
- That's lovely.
- I knew my dreams would come true.

00:17:17.078 --> 00:17:19.121
I mean, I had Eunseong.

00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:21.332
I'm used to always getting what I want.

00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:25.294
- Here, grandma!
- Now all that's missing

00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:27.296
is Junik to complete the picture.

00:17:28.297 --> 00:17:31.050
A house, a son, and a husband.

00:17:32.134 --> 00:17:33.177
You're lucky.

00:17:33.928 --> 00:17:36.556
The one you don't have
is the least important.

00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:45.398
Ah…

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:49.694
Mother, why did you bring Eunseong
to your room last night?

00:17:57.243 --> 00:17:59.704
I couldn't get back to sleep
after the siren woke me up.

00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:03.624
And I've always slept better
with the children next to me.

00:18:13.884 --> 00:18:15.553
I think there's a good chance

00:18:16.429 --> 00:18:18.764
Stella Young and Kang Hanna
are the same person.

00:18:21.934 --> 00:18:22.935
What do you mean?

00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:25.730
All the countries where
that arms dealer's been seen.

00:18:25.813 --> 00:18:29.483
Somebody who imported
structural steel plates from Poland,

00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:33.821
precision sensors from Switzerland,
and engineers from Sweden.

00:18:33.904 --> 00:18:35.406
Kang Hanna and her son

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:37.491
were in those places.

00:18:37.575 --> 00:18:41.287
Malmö, Sweden,
in 2022, when I was six.

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:45.791
I have a lot more.

00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:47.543
I've traveled around a lot.

00:18:50.713 --> 00:18:53.841
Katowice, Poland. Lausanne, Switzerland.

00:18:56.969 --> 00:19:00.556
If Kang Hanna is the same as Stella Young,

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.683
do you think she killed Junik?

00:19:05.269 --> 00:19:08.564
Changhee, do you have the Telegram ID
of the person who sent the video?

00:19:08.648 --> 00:19:09.690
Yeah, one second.

00:19:11.567 --> 00:19:12.985
Number is

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:17.990
010-6133-8758.

00:19:21.077 --> 00:19:23.746
I found this in one of
Father Yang's bibles.

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:26.874
That's the card Sergeant Kim had.

00:19:28.626 --> 00:19:31.921
I saw a photo of a card
with this number on his phone.

00:19:32.004 --> 00:19:33.339
The photo…

00:19:34.131 --> 00:19:35.132
SEND

00:19:45.976 --> 00:19:47.687
Junik had the exact same card.

00:19:50.606 --> 00:19:53.943
Oh, look! You're doing
so good honey, you're a natural.

00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:56.028
That's it. Very good.

00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:05.079
I really admire you, Mother.

00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:10.126
You raised Junik.

00:20:10.668 --> 00:20:13.546
All your heart went into it,
even though he wasn't your own.

00:20:16.757 --> 00:20:19.802
I mean, I gave birth to Eunseong
and I can barely handle him.

00:20:23.514 --> 00:20:25.433
So someone said something to you?

00:20:31.355 --> 00:20:32.773
Grandmother told me.

00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:36.652
She told me Junik was born
out of wedlock as well,

00:20:36.736 --> 00:20:39.613
so Eunseong should never be
made to feel different either.

00:20:49.874 --> 00:20:53.252
Before Junik died,
do you think he knew that?

00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:57.548
I'm guessing not.

00:20:57.631 --> 00:21:00.843
Grandmother said you worked really hard
to keep the truth from him.

00:21:04.972 --> 00:21:06.557
I had to make a choice.

00:21:07.433 --> 00:21:10.352
The first time I held him
as a newborn, I decided…

00:21:12.271 --> 00:21:15.107
he'd be my son for as long as he lived.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.448
Which is exactly how it went.

00:21:51.018 --> 00:21:52.019
That day…

00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:55.773
The day Junik was killed.

00:21:58.609 --> 00:22:00.444
He was about to tell me something.

00:22:01.028 --> 00:22:02.196
What's going on?

00:22:02.988 --> 00:22:04.490
Why won't you just tell me?

00:22:05.991 --> 00:22:07.326
Why don't we talk tonight?

00:22:08.494 --> 00:22:10.454
To be honest, it's a long story.

00:22:17.503 --> 00:22:19.421
He was going to explain it to me.

00:22:20.172 --> 00:22:22.007
Why did Junik become a spy, Sanho?

00:22:22.633 --> 00:22:24.260
If the submarine isn't real,

00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:27.972
then China and North Korea
are just puppets.

00:22:28.055 --> 00:22:30.891
And some third party is
the one pulling the strings.

00:22:30.975 --> 00:22:34.645
If becoming a spy
is the only way to learn the truth,

00:22:36.272 --> 00:22:38.065
then I think I'd become one, too.

00:22:45.573 --> 00:22:47.324
You have to draw the line here.

00:22:48.993 --> 00:22:50.911
If your husband was a spy or not,

00:22:51.579 --> 00:22:53.664
whether Kang Hanna killed him or not,

00:22:53.747 --> 00:22:55.374
that'll remain between them.

00:22:56.792 --> 00:22:59.587
Or you'll be sucked into this whirlpool
before you realize it.

00:23:01.755 --> 00:23:03.507
You need to get out to survive.

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:05.676
Right now, Munju.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.597
Your only option is to leave.

00:23:20.733 --> 00:23:21.859
Hi, Miji.

00:23:22.359 --> 00:23:23.861
Where are you right now?

00:23:24.528 --> 00:23:25.529
Why?

00:23:26.322 --> 00:23:27.364
You gotta get out.

00:23:27.448 --> 00:23:29.074
The whole house is bugged.

00:23:35.998 --> 00:23:39.501
Shocking news.
Where is presidential candidate Seo Munju?

00:23:39.585 --> 00:23:42.796
And what is she doing with
her handsome North Korean bodyguard?

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:47.176
Seo Munju, the widow of Assemblyman Jang,
hired Paik Sanho to protect her.

00:23:47.259 --> 00:23:50.971
They first met at the place
where her husband was shot and killed.

00:23:51.513 --> 00:23:55.059
{\an8}Beginning a relationship in secret,
they started living together.

00:23:55.809 --> 00:23:58.312
{\an8}But who could blame a lonely widow

00:23:58.395 --> 00:24:01.523
for falling in love
with her dashing bodyguard?

00:24:02.107 --> 00:24:04.526
However, according to
a recent tip we received,

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:07.154
her bodyguard, Paik Sanho,
is from North Korea.

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:11.408
{\an8}Was it really a coincidence that
he became Seo Munju's bodyguard?

00:24:11.492 --> 00:24:15.329
{\an8}Who was really benefiting from her
exposure of the North Korean submarine?

00:24:15.412 --> 00:24:18.415
What if Ambassador Seo
is being used by North Korea?

00:24:18.499 --> 00:24:20.834
The two of them are together as we speak.

00:24:21.585 --> 00:24:25.881
Seo Munju and Paik Sanho are
currently staying in a secluded hideout.

00:24:26.632 --> 00:24:30.928
We have obtained a recording of
a private conversation from last night.

00:24:34.014 --> 00:24:36.225
Honestly,
I don't really care about the war.

00:24:36.809 --> 00:24:38.936
I only want to run away with you, Munju.

00:24:41.438 --> 00:24:42.606
Let's go.

00:24:43.607 --> 00:24:44.942
You mean that?

00:24:45.776 --> 00:24:46.986
I mean it.

00:24:48.237 --> 00:24:49.863
Let's escape together.

00:25:36.618 --> 00:25:38.287
Get media responses.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:42.041
I want to know what they're saying
about Ms. Seo every three hours.

00:25:42.124 --> 00:25:46.628
And look into all of our legal avenues
against this Freedom Lab channel.

00:26:13.864 --> 00:26:14.990
That's enough.

00:26:20.329 --> 00:26:22.498
There's no bugs in here.

00:26:25.084 --> 00:26:27.044
I don't regret anything that happened.

00:26:35.969 --> 00:26:37.429
I was happy.

00:26:39.723 --> 00:26:41.433
If nobody wants me here anymore,

00:26:42.392 --> 00:26:43.644
I can just leave.

00:26:45.854 --> 00:26:47.564
If this is how it ends,

00:26:49.066 --> 00:26:50.192
it's fine.

00:26:54.863 --> 00:26:55.864
Let's go.

00:26:57.616 --> 00:26:59.159
I can get you outta here.

00:27:02.079 --> 00:27:03.831
There's a ship that's leaving tonight.

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:01.513
Are you going somewhere?

00:28:04.016 --> 00:28:06.977
I'll come back soon.
Just pack up and wait for a while.

00:28:07.561 --> 00:28:08.937
Where are you going?

00:28:10.355 --> 00:28:11.815
I'll explain it to you later.

00:28:11.899 --> 00:28:13.025
I'll go with you.

00:28:14.443 --> 00:28:15.861
You're safer waiting here.

00:28:24.745 --> 00:28:27.915
You can have a gun
and know how to shoot it,

00:28:28.999 --> 00:28:31.084
but it's different when it comes
to killing someone.

00:28:32.127 --> 00:28:35.380
In war, the one who shoots their enemy
first is the one who gets to go home.

00:28:37.716 --> 00:28:39.635
You understand what I'm saying, right?

00:28:43.513 --> 00:28:44.723
I'll be back soon.

00:29:11.416 --> 00:29:12.626
SEO MUNJU SCANDAL ESCALATES

00:29:12.709 --> 00:29:14.336
'SEO MUNJU SHOCK'
SENDS KOSPI DOWN 2.94%…

00:29:15.379 --> 00:29:17.214
WILL SEO FALL AFTER
HER METEORIC RISE?

00:29:17.297 --> 00:29:18.715
ENJOYING A SECRET RENDEZVOUS

00:29:18.799 --> 00:29:20.425
A MONTH AFTER
HER HUSBAND'S DEATH…

00:29:36.733 --> 00:29:38.318
Honey! Oh my God.

00:29:38.402 --> 00:29:40.153
Okseon, did you hear?

00:29:40.237 --> 00:29:43.198
I thought she was an innocent lamb,
but she's a filthy whore!

00:29:43.281 --> 00:29:45.409
Oh, my poor Junik.

00:29:45.492 --> 00:29:48.370
- I'm sure he's spinning in his grave.
- Yeah, I hear you, Mother.

00:29:48.453 --> 00:29:51.540
Can we do this later, though?
I have a phone call to make.

00:29:55.961 --> 00:29:58.255
Director, I need to speak to you.

00:30:01.508 --> 00:30:02.634
Let's go.

00:30:05.804 --> 00:30:06.847
You mean that?

00:30:08.056 --> 00:30:09.182
I mean it.

00:30:10.559 --> 00:30:11.893
Let's escape together.

00:30:53.977 --> 00:30:57.397
Nowadays, these advanced
programs and hardware

00:30:57.481 --> 00:30:59.357
allow a greater range of transmission.

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:03.153
It's also battery-free,
so it can be used indefinitely.

00:31:05.072 --> 00:31:07.199
This one's been upgraded a fair amount,

00:31:07.282 --> 00:31:10.410
compared to the one you gave
to the Japanese ambassador.

00:31:10.494 --> 00:31:12.329
The recordings
are automatically backed up

00:31:12.412 --> 00:31:14.206
real-time to the cloud,

00:31:14.289 --> 00:31:16.708
so even if it gets damaged,
the files are safe.

00:31:21.004 --> 00:31:22.339
Let's go.

00:31:24.132 --> 00:31:25.258
You mean that?

00:31:26.384 --> 00:31:27.511
I mean it.

00:31:28.887 --> 00:31:30.138
Let's escape together.

00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:45.862
There was another bug.

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:47.531
How many did you plant?

00:31:47.614 --> 00:31:49.783
What are you talking about?

00:31:50.408 --> 00:31:54.579
We agreed on a wiretap to monitor her,
and then you broke it.

00:31:54.663 --> 00:31:55.872
And that's all we got.

00:31:55.956 --> 00:31:57.124
Now get off of me!

00:32:07.717 --> 00:32:10.470
How did you know I was going to Mongolia?

00:32:13.557 --> 00:32:14.808
Talk!

00:32:14.891 --> 00:32:17.477
Who else would listen
and release those files?

00:32:24.526 --> 00:32:25.694
Drop your weapon.

00:32:28.446 --> 00:32:31.950
Paik Sanho,
you're under arrest for espionage.

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:34.911
Keeping busy?

00:32:36.329 --> 00:32:38.957
Rounding up innocent men for espionage?

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.041
No.

00:32:40.959 --> 00:32:42.335
You're a real spy.

00:32:43.211 --> 00:32:45.338
We're well aware Kim Hansang hired you.

00:32:56.683 --> 00:32:58.310
Let's go.

00:32:59.394 --> 00:33:02.564
You don't realize that the entity
paying you through Valkyrie is a bank

00:33:02.647 --> 00:33:04.482
based out of Macau, Cheonil Credit.

00:33:04.566 --> 00:33:07.944
It's a North Korean state-bank
used for their foreign weapons purchases.

00:33:08.653 --> 00:33:13.491
Every financial transaction is
personally signed for by Kim Hansang.

00:33:19.539 --> 00:33:22.250
In other words, you're merely
a North Korean pawn

00:33:22.334 --> 00:33:23.960
hired to eliminate the Ambassador.

00:33:25.754 --> 00:33:27.047
Now, tell me,

00:33:27.631 --> 00:33:30.634
was it also your plan to make her
fall in love with you?

00:33:32.844 --> 00:33:36.514
All thanks to you, Seo Munju
has fallen completely from grace.

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:51.988
By the way, your grandmother

00:33:52.906 --> 00:33:54.366
wanted you to have this.

00:33:59.079 --> 00:34:01.539
You said you would come get her,
but then you never did.

00:34:01.623 --> 00:34:03.291
That poor woman was so worried.

00:34:03.375 --> 00:34:05.126
She's with our people now.

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:06.586
I told her you'd come for her,

00:34:07.963 --> 00:34:10.006
once you're finished with your work.

00:34:29.567 --> 00:34:30.944
You assholes…

00:34:31.569 --> 00:34:33.822
I'm giving you a second chance here.

00:34:35.031 --> 00:34:37.409
A ship is leaving
Pyeongtaek Port tomorrow night.

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:43.832
You and Seo Munju
were escaping to Mongolia, right?

00:34:43.915 --> 00:34:46.501
Before that ship can cross
the maritime border,

00:34:46.584 --> 00:34:48.169
our coast guard will seize it.

00:34:48.712 --> 00:34:50.380
You'll be presumed to have escaped,

00:34:50.463 --> 00:34:52.632
jumping into the sea during the raid

00:34:52.716 --> 00:34:54.050
while Seo Munju

00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:57.345
is caught as a spy,
defecting to the North.

00:34:58.471 --> 00:35:02.475
But you could take your grandmother,
and go wherever you want.

00:35:21.494 --> 00:35:22.746
Good.

00:35:23.872 --> 00:35:25.415
You're making the right decision.

00:36:02.535 --> 00:36:04.037
Get him outta here.

00:36:23.723 --> 00:36:25.183
Who are you, really?

00:36:25.767 --> 00:36:28.311
We agreed
on a wire tap to monitor her!

00:36:28.395 --> 00:36:29.938
Why did you come to me?

00:36:31.231 --> 00:36:34.734
Was it also your plan to make her
fall in love with you?

00:36:39.989 --> 00:36:43.993
All thanks to you, Seo Munju
has fallen completely from grace.

00:37:39.382 --> 00:37:42.260
Ground floor.

00:38:16.211 --> 00:38:18.338
"Don't trust
the people closest to you."

00:38:28.765 --> 00:38:30.600
"Always have an escape plan."

00:38:35.021 --> 00:38:37.065
"Never go back to Korea."

00:38:48.159 --> 00:38:49.410
Munju!

00:38:54.999 --> 00:38:56.292
Munju!

00:39:08.805 --> 00:39:09.806
Munju!

00:39:11.891 --> 00:39:12.892
Where are you?

00:39:13.935 --> 00:39:14.978
Munju!

00:39:40.295 --> 00:39:42.046
"Never go back to Korea."

00:39:46.551 --> 00:39:47.552
Dear Mom…

00:39:49.637 --> 00:39:52.015
I always remembered what you told me.

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:09.908
I remembered because
I wanted to prove you wrong.

00:40:59.832 --> 00:41:01.292
But I trusted him.

00:41:24.899 --> 00:41:27.235
I really thought he had come to save me.

00:41:41.249 --> 00:41:42.792
I was a fool.

00:41:43.334 --> 00:41:44.752
I was a fool.

00:41:49.465 --> 00:41:50.675
What do I do now?

00:41:54.137 --> 00:41:56.097
I have nowhere left to go.

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.834
SEO MUNJU

00:42:33.134 --> 00:42:35.053
SEO MUNJU,
THE SUBMARINE EXISTS

00:43:50.711 --> 00:43:56.050
WHO IS THIS?

00:43:56.134 --> 00:43:59.220
GEUMSEOL PORT,
NOVEMBER 2 AT 22:00
