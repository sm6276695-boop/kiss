[The Antagonist May Be Late, But He Will Surely Arrive]

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.860
I instructed you to find someone, not to abduct them.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.170
My lord,

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.090
this lady came here of her own accord.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.890
Why would she cry this much

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.370
if she truly came here of her own accord?

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:09.300
Your Majesty,

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.300
this girl actually knows your identity.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.740
What's your name?

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.690
Liao Tingyan.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.340
Why did she enter my dream without permission and stir my heart?

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.620
Why did she show up here

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.650
by coincidence?

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.650
There's something more to this than meets the eye.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.740
I cannot just let my guard down because of that dream.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.980
Why did you cry?

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.770
In the realm of men, absence stirs no grief.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.180
But when we meet again, grief blossoms at once.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.980
Do you know me?

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.300
Of course I know you.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:36.370
Have we met before?

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.060
This is our first encounter in this lifetime.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.980

If so, why did you come to me?

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:55.740
Just to see you.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.620
You look the same.

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.940
However, those clear eyes,

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.100
the gentle contours,

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.690

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.660

What nonsense are you talking about?

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.540
Do you know who I am?

♪Even if this life leads to ruin...♪

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:40.860
You are Sima Jiao.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.100
You're the emperor of Hu Kingdom.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.570
If so, have you heard

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:50.890
that I've slain countless lives?

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.540
I once

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.690
peeled the skin of an individual who criticized me harshly

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.300
and hung it on the palace wall

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.690
until the wind and rain wore him down,

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.250
leaving nothing but a white skeleton.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.690
In the past, you would vanquish one's clan for no reason.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.980
You would blow up half of Gengchen Celestial Palace when you cast a spell.

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.420
You would reduce demon generals to ashes

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.540
just so you could use them as fertilizer.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.980
I'm not one to appreciate delicate beauty.

I'm smiling at how adorable you've become.

I finally see you again.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.450
Your body is fine now.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.180
But you've lost all of your spiritual power.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.100
You still look the same.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:30.130
However, there's something different about you somehow.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:38.370
Now your face bears a hint of living warmth.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.330
You no longer look as pale as before.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.100
I'm sure your life will be much more peaceful

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.010
as a mortal in this lifetime.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:15.770
I'm going to die soon.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:17.940
Heaven may want me dead,

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.810
but I won't hand my life to it.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.860
Would you have been this carefree all along

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.690
without the memories we had together?

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.180
Your Majesty,

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:52.210
we found the individual who rescued Wei Xianyu.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:00.810
Is that her?

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.330
Have you identified the individual?

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:06.970
We haven't gotten our hands on any leads yet.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:09.300
I fell asleep for no reason last night.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.730
Could it be that she has done something to me?

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.420
If she's one of the Marquis of Nanyan's retainers,

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.140
entering my dream

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:18.780
must be one of their plots.

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:21.180
Get ready.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.570
I'm going to take her to the palace.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.210
But...

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:27.140
Her background is still unknown.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.090
Your Majesty, no matter how much you like her,

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.980
it's inappropriate to take her back to the palace.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.260
She's not a mortal.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.300
With our current strength,

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.090
I'm afraid we can't do anything about her.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.210
I just don't want to alert her to our intention.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.490
Since she approached me on purpose,

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.570
I'll pretend to follow her will

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:49.970
and take her back to the palace.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.810
Your Majesty, you rarely speak usually.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:54.810
But you spoke quite a lot just to explain yourself.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:57.940
I shall make the preparations.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.330
Since when did food from the mortal realm become this good?

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:34.780
The mortal realm?

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.570
Are you trying to say that you aren't a mortal?

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.300
You can treat me as a fairy.

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:42.330
Do you think

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:46.940
such words alone are enough to entice me?

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.690
In your current state,

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.540
it's normal for you not to trust me.

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:54.060
But I'm curious about something.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:55.810
What is it?

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.060
How should I entice you

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.020
so that you will fall for me?

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:06.420
Such audacity!

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:08.810
I know.

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:10.330
Judging from your personality,

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.380
you'll surely suspect me for having an ulterior motive.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.970
But now, you no longer have the Truth Spell.

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:17.610
I have no choice but to gain your trust gradually.

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:22.300
Fine.

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:25.090
If so, from now on,

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:29.260
you shall be my spouse.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.140
It's good to be young.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.780
Even when you were spouting such nonsense,

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:40.090
I couldn't even be angry when I saw that tender face of yours.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:00.900
The height of summer has yet to come,

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.610
yet look at how much you're sweating.

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.020
After being harmed by a conceited scum,

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:09.060
I was left with a heat-sensitive constitution.

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:15.330
Who's that scum?

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:21.660
Will you take revenge on my behalf if I tell you his identity?

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:28.490
I might consider it.

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:31.850
He's something else.

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:33.140
You can't afford to offend him.

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:37.380
Is he even more powerful than I?

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:44.450
I suppose you two are equal.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.730
There's a main road leading to Yan City, you know?

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.450
Why must we go through the woods?

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.060
Aren't you afraid of bandits?

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:02.060
Why would I need to fear bandits

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:03.660
when I have you with me?

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.970
I don't know any martial arts.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.690
You said you were a fairy, right?

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.570
Even fairies aren't omnipotent, you know?

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.090
Otherwise, I would have plenty of ways to deal with you.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.420
Don't try to frame me. I did nothing.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:23.940
It has nothing to do with you.

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:26.540
Seems like I have another headache.

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:28.090
Turn around.

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:29.540
My master was a healer.

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:31.900
You'll be fine after getting some rubs. Come.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:32.490
No need for that.

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:35.060
Even my imperial physicians couldn't do anything about it.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:36.660
Just turn around.

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:45.610
Why is my heart beating so fast?

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:48.610
Don't tell me I fell for her just like that.

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:51.140
No way.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:53.490
No doubt it was her enchantments

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:55.660
that brought this ailment upon my heart.

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:57.450
Relax.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.780
Stop overthinking things.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.060
I mustn't sleep.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.690
Even if his life was spared,

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:12.660
his soul was still damaged.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.730
It hasn't merged well

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:16.300
with his current body.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:19.610
That's why he's having constant headaches.

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:22.570
Why must you make things so hard on yourself

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.020
wherever you go?

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:34.300
Although these are just normal pills

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:35.810
in Serene Vale,

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.660
they're more than enough

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:39.730
to cure a mortal.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.260
Is she trying to poison me?

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.380
Silly boy.

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:53.450
You don't appreciate a delicate beauty like me at all.

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:56.210
Just sleep in peace.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.610
Assassins! Protect His Majesty!

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:43.850
They did show up.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:45.570
They did show up?

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:46.690
So, you're doing this on purpose

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:47.900
just so you could make the assassins show up?

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.300
He has excellent martial arts skills.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.180
If I had no spells at my command,

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.780
I might not be able to defeat him.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.540
So, he was pretending to be weak and harmless all along.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.140
Sima Jiao actually traveled to the mortal realm

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.490
and became the emperor of Hu Kingdom.

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.940
I assume he's trying to stop me from unlocking Nine Nether Purgatory

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:26.260
and releasing my demonic forces.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:01.490
Be careful!

00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:06.180
Liao Tingyan did make a swift move, huh?

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:09.940
To think that she has actually reunited with Sima Jiao in the mortal realm.

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:14.490
With her protecting Sima Jiao,

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:17.580
this has become quite the problem.

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:27.420
I almost forgot.

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:28.870
I have to cast my spells sparingly

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.050
and settle down as a mortal.

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:03.690
Keep him alive.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.140
Such petty mortal tricks won't work on me.

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:24.660
Are you okay?

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:28.180
Imperial physician!

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:31.140
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:37.010
Madam Yan is seriously wounded.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.340
But why does she look like she's...

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:41.010
It hurts.

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.100
Why have you

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:55.340
stopped bleeding?

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:02.010
I...

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:04.010
I saw

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:05.180
that you were stabbed by an assassin.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:06.970
You were bleeding profusely.

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:08.580
How did you stop bleeding

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.340
in the blink of an eye?

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:15.770
Your Majesty, I'm sure you're mistaken.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.450
It was just a scratch.

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:20.490
It may look scary,

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:21.530
but in reality, I'm fine.

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.300
I shall treat Madam Yan's wound.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.180
If she's one of the Marquis of Nanyan's retainers,

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:33.210
she'll surely try to kill me.

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:36.010
But she rescued me just now.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.210
Seems like she isn't one of his retainers.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:41.900
If so, what is the demon lady after

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.290
by staying with me?

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:55.140
I merely used some of my spiritual power.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.140
What a useless body.

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:21.580
Sima Jiao.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.660
If it weren't for you,

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.140
I would never be forced to maintain my cultivation

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.250
with another's blood.

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:30.580
I swear I'll pay you back

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:33.420
for this.

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:39.140
[Marquis of Nanyan Residence, Yan City]

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:43.970
My lord,

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:46.940
Wei Xianyu's men tried to assassinate His Majesty when he was on his way back.

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:48.050
His Majesty has arrested them.

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:51.530
What about Wei Xianyu?

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:54.140
He was arrested as well.

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.140
He has done a lot for me all these years.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:07.580
I can no longer keep him with me.

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.660
It must've been tough on you.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.180
After all,

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.900
I wouldn't feel at ease entrusting this secret

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:21.290
to someone else to deliver.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:23.970
My lord, you're too courteous.

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:26.580
At present, Sima Jiao has grown suspicious.

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:29.250
My lord, you must be careful.

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:05.620
Who are you?

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:08.210
Marquis, you have endured hardships and bided your time for so long.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.690
You did it so that you could end Sima Jiao, am I right?

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:15.250
Speak. Who exactly are you?

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.340
Marquis, I came here to discuss a plan with you earnestly.

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:26.050
I hope you can treat me with respect.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:27.900
Madam.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:29.620
Please let me go.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:32.580
We can talk this over.

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:41.940
Madam,

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.860
why are you here?

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:48.250
I know what you wish to achieve.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:53.530
I can help you seize the empire.

00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:58.210
Why are you helping me?

00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:59.340
Marquis,

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:00.970
do you know what's on Mount Hu?

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:03.820
I only know that the monarchs of Hu have all been bound to guard the place

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.660
generation after generation.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:08.580
This Mount Hu was called

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.730
Mount Feng a thousand years ago.

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:13.490
There's something I need within the mountain.

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:16.730
After performing the worship ritual, the emperors of Hu

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:19.290
would then obtain the imperial seal that grants the power to open it.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.010
That's why I came here to seek your help.

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:28.940
Madam, why didn't you

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:30.730
possess the emperor directly, then?

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.860
Wouldn't you be able to achieve your goal if you did so?

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:36.770
It's because you and Sima Jiao possess

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:39.010
the True Dragon Aura.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:47.290
Did you say that I possess the True Dragon Aura?

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.490
Heaven's mandate bestows upon the royal descendants the True Dragon Aura,

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.730
even the deities cannot touch them easily.

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:54.970
Only those who possess the True Dragon Aura

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.900
have the right to ascend the throne.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.100
Sima Jiao is a fatuous ruler.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:01.820
Therefore,

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.250
Marquis, I'm willing to help you take Sima Jiao's life

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:05.660
and aid you in becoming the ruler.

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:09.050
Madam, you're a reclusive deity.

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:14.940
It's normal for you to have no knowledge about our worldly realm.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.860
But Sima Jiao's worship ritual is nearing.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.580
If he dies right now

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:22.420
for no apparent reason,

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.180
even if I do become the ruler,

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:28.770
it will surely draw criticism from others.

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:36.180
If that's the case,

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.050
I can act according to your will.

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.970
I will uphold justice and eradicate treachery

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:44.580
on your behalf.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:45.970
However,

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.380
if you act only by the methods of the mortal realm,

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:50.900
I fear you will end up losing everything.

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.980
[Imperial Palace, Yan City]

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:08.980
[Chen Tang, Minister of Justice]

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:10.690
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.900
That's enough.

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.820
When you served as my companion reader,

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:17.970
you dined and traveled alongside me.

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:19.940
Spare the formalities.

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:27.820
About the task I've assigned to you,

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.180
how's the progress?

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:34.620
Your Majesty.

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.940
Wei Xianyu has been escorted back to Yan City

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:38.660
for a strict interrogation.

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:40.420
As for Madam Yan,

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:42.290
the assassins said that they didn't know her.

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:45.210
She was never in contact with Wei Xianyu

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:46.970
when she was in Liyang County.

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:49.010
That rescue by the riverbank must have been

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.210
a coincidental act by Madam Yan.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:54.690
Indeed.

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:57.690
She isn't one of the Marquis of Nanyan's retainers.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.380
But there's something wrong

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.180
about Madam Yan.

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:06.210
She's not from Liyang County

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.010
nor is she a non-local.

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:11.580
It's like she appeared out of nowhere.

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:14.970
Naturally, she's not a mortal.

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.620
However,

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:19.420
if she isn't one of the Marquis of Nanyan's retainers,

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:22.530
why would she appear beside me?

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:25.940
What is she up to?

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:28.970
Madam, are you saying

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:33.860
that Sima Jiao is assisted by a master as well?

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:37.210
Madam Yan, whom Sima Jiao has brought back from Liyang County,

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.530
is a powerful demon lady.

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:45.140
Is that true?

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:47.690
Marquis, if you don't believe me,

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.450
you can tell your spies

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.970
to launch an investigation.

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:02.940
Madam.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.050
His Majesty has given us his instructions.

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.970
There will be a palace banquet tonight.

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.340
Please prepare yourself

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.100
and attend the banquet.

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:08.290
All right.

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:09.730
By the way,

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.010
Sir Eunuch,

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.730
what about the assassins

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:14.690
who were after His Majesty?

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.010
Wei Xianyu and his underlings

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.660
have all been taken into custody and are now under interrogation.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.050
Madam, please don't worry.

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:21.860
Have you guys obtained any results?

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:25.180
It'll be difficult to make him confess who the mastermind is.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:26.580
You see...

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:31.140
So, there's someone else besides Wei Xianyu

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:34.100
who's out to get His Majesty.

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.340
If so, isn't His Majesty in danger?

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:39.100
I don't know about that.

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.050
Madam, please stop putting me on the spot.

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.730
Now, Sima Jiao has no memory of his past.

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:46.690
He's wary of me.

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:50.290
If I deal with the mastermind on his behalf,

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.250
not only can I protect him,

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:54.730
but I can also dispel his doubts about me.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:56.180
Madam,

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:58.380
please stop worrying about this.

00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:59.490
Please rest well.

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:01.620
His Majesty was worried about your injury.

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:04.010
He instructed the imperial physician to give you another diagnosis.

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:05.210
No need for that.

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:06.250
I'm fine.

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:07.580
Madam, please do not decline us.

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.860
It's better to be safe than sorry.

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:11.490
Imperial Physician Yi.

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.290
Greetings, Madam.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:31.660
Imperial Physician Yi,

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:33.180
how is Madam's situation?

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.290
Her wound is no longer of any concern.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.490
Madam, you were bleeding profusely when the assassin stabbed you.

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:41.120
But now,

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.270
it seems like it wasn't serious.

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:43.970
It was

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:45.290
merely a scratch.

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:47.290
His Majesty is kicking up too much of a fuss over it.

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:49.340
[Meijing, Liangchen]
That means His Majesty is concerned.

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:51.210
And, Madam, although this is your first day here,

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:53.180
His Majesty has already invited you to a palace banquet.

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:55.010
His other consorts have never received such treatment before.

00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:57.660
His other consorts?

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:00.380
Do not gossip about His Majesty.

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:05.340
It's well as long as you're in good health.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.680
For now, it is enough to rely on dietary remedies

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:08.730
to nourish your qi and blood.

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:10.490
Thank you, Imperial Physician Yi.

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.340
Liangchen, Meijing.

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:21.620
Does His Majesty have a lot of consorts?

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.100
Madam, only you

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:25.050
and Noble Consort Si Xian are consorts, the daughter of Marquis of Nanyan.

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:26.620
As for the rest of them,

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:27.770
at most, they're Beauties.

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:29.900
The rest of them?

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:32.620
How many Beauties does he have?

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:34.470
Madam, you don't need to hold them to heart.

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:36.210
His Majesty brought you back personally.

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:37.940
As for the Beauties, His Majesty was forced to take them

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.900
as they were forced in by the powerful.

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:40.820
They cannot compare to you.

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:42.450
So what?

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.490
He still made them a part of his imperial harem.

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:48.180
He has forgotten about me,

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:49.770
yet I still have to help him with everything I have.

00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:52.450
This is infuriating indeed.

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:54.660
Your Majesty,

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.010
I've sent the imperial physician

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:57.730
to give her a diagnosis as per your instructions.

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:00.180
Madam Yan's wound has indeed healed.

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:01.210
Your Majesty.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:03.250
Are you sure you want to keep someone like her

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:04.180
by your side?

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:05.900
What if she has an ulterior motive?

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.420
Speaking of ulterior motive,

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:10.940
Marquis of Nanyan stayed at Chengming Hall

00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:12.820
until dawn, am I correct?

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:14.820
Indeed.

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.900
Your Majesty, his actions were offensive.

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:18.940
Why aren't you infuriated by them?

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:26.010
That'll spice things up for tonight's banquet.

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:31.940
You truly have keen eyes.

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:33.420
Keen eyes, huh?

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:34.660
Madam Yan

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.730
was stabbed by Wei Xianyu's bodyguard.

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.010
But her wounds have healed

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.140
in just a day.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.250
I heard

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:45.140
that on the day Madam Yan went searching for Sima Jiao,

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:46.290
the heavens displayed strange omens,

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:47.580
and fierce winds swept across the land.

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:49.250
Is that true?

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:50.580
Indeed.

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:56.290
Madam Yan is a demon lady indeed.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:57.450
My lord,

00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:58.380
there's one more thing.

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.450
His Majesty has instructed Madam Yan

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:01.660
to attend the palace banquet tonight.

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:04.340
I'm sure His Majesty holds her in high regard.

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.860
Keep a close eye on the palace.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.140
Report to me immediately

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:11.620
if they make any movements.

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:13.250
Yes, My lord.

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:20.050
My lord, now, you believe

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:21.490
that Liao Tingyan is a demon lady, right?

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:24.690
That was unexpected indeed.

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:29.490
Sima Jiao actually has a demon lady by his side.

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:32.140
If so, doesn't that mean

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:33.420
my daughter, Noble Consort Si Xian, is in danger?

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.290
Therefore, our priority

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:37.450
is to get rid of Madam Yan,

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:38.450
who's been protecting His Majesty.

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:40.580
We mustn't let her foil our plan.

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.100
If so, the banquet tonight

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:45.730
serves as an excellent opportunity for you, Madam.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.820
If you're able to get rid of Wei Xianyu

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:51.340
and that demon lady,

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:56.250
I shall join forces with you and achieve great deeds together.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.050
You may leave.

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:41.380
At today's palace banquet, no state affairs shall be entertained.

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:44.140
My dear subjects, please enjoy yourselves.

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:48.450
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:50.490
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.660
Your Majesty, thank you for looking after me.

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:33.450
That dish was annoying me.

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:40.730
[Beauty Yu]
Why isn't Sister Si Xian here

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:42.620
to crush her arrogance yet?

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:51.770
As usual,

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:54.340
I've prepared gifts for you all.

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:55.620
I hope you all

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.050
won't betray my sincerity.

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:00.770
Chancellor.

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.050
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:05.100
I'll start with you.

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:08.050
The views in Lingnan are impeccable.

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:11.970
Are you willing to live there for some years to come?

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.490
You're just banishing him.

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:22.090
Your Majesty, please spare me!

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:26.050
I dare not open the door of Chengming Hall

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.090
and allow outsiders to enter again!

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:29.570
What are you saying?

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:33.220
Even if Marquis of Nanyan and Noble Consort Si Xian

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:34.820
feigned illness and did not attend the banquet,

00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:36.860
you shouldn't just badmouth them

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:39.130
by saying that they are outsiders.

00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:42.650
That's not what I mean! Your Majesty, please spare me!

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:44.530
Your Majesty, please spare me!

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.650
Your Majesty, please spare me!

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:49.970
The Empress Dowager has arrived!

00:34:57.550 --> 00:34:59.220
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.130
You're already an adult.

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:05.300
Are you sure you want to throw another childish tantrum?

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:15.900
[Empress Dowager]

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.900
The Sima Clan has already been vanquished.

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:20.010
There's no way their souls still exist.

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.090
I suppose only her appearance resembles her.

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:26.340
I suppose this can be seen as an act to make up

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.650
for Sima Jiao's regret in his past lifetime for not receiving any motherly love.

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:36.220
This must be Madam Yan, whom His Majesty appointed not long ago.

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:42.010
Why are you staring at me like that?

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:46.530
Indeed.

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:50.570
Your Majesty, when I saw your graceful

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:51.700
and extraordinary presence,

00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:53.010
you reminded me

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:54.900
of the goddess in the temple back at my hometown.

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.900
Please pardon me.

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:00.090
You do have a sweet tongue.

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.820
No wonder His Majesty fell for you.

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:08.610
I want to know

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:11.650
where the goddess you mentioned is enshrined.

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.970
I wish to visit her one day.

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:17.490
Everyone, take your seats.

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:20.900
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:31.900
I don't know

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.130
where your hometown is.

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:39.050
My hometown is in Shu.

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.860
If so, why did you head to Liyang County?

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:49.940
Madam, you have to answer Her Majesty's questions.

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.820
My mother and I have raised silkworms to make a living since young.

00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:57.780
There was a severe drought last year.

00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:00.380
My mother became depressed and ill.

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.450
In the end, she passed away from her illness.

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:09.050
So I had no choice but to take along the neighbor's daughter

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:10.940
and make a living together.

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:15.740
We only managed to settle down in Liyang County.

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:19.300
I see.

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.340
Such a poor girl.

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:26.220
Since you've joined the palace,

00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:28.860
you just need to serve His Majesty well.

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:31.300
We won't let you suffer again.

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:32.490
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:45.940
Your Majesty, since this is a fine occasion,

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.170
[Beauty Tong]
let me offer you a toast.

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:57.170
I suppose there's no escaping poisoned wine in the palace, huh?

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.610
Now, it has turned into fine liquor.

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:09.220
Sima Jiao, you're lucky to have a gem like me around.

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:10.650
You should be grateful.

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:24.300
Demonic energy? Sima Jiao!

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:32.300
It's You Yan.

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:33.450
Arrest her.

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:34.220
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:38.050
Why did she do that?

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:39.590
Why did she do that?

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:40.860
Why did she try to assassinate him out of nowhere?

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:43.610
Are you okay?

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:54.220
Your Majesty, this is the Poria chicken soup you love the most.

00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:56.420
Her Majesty made it herself.

00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:57.900
It took her several hours to prepare it.

00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:00.380
All of you may leave.

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:01.300
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:03.490
Thank you, Mother.

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.940
I was negligent in my duty.

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:07.170
Sorry for the scare.

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:10.900
It's not your fault.

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:13.740
You didn't even touch your chopsticks

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:15.700
during the palace banquet.

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:19.490
But that Madam Yan?

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:21.780
She had a great appetite.

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:27.090
She never gets upset

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:29.490
as long as there's good food.

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:35.380
Do not dwell on the endless matters beyond this life.

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:39.090
For now, let us savor the current life.

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:41.780
She's an intelligent woman.

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.490
I was perplexed at the start.

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.610
Before, no matter how I tried to slip someone into your arms,

00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:47.010
you just wouldn't accept them.

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.940
But now, you actually brought a woman back of your own accord.

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:54.450
After seeing her today, I can tell that she's truly remarkable.

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:00.570
She's indeed different from the rest.

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:07.220
If you truly fancy her,

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:09.650
why don't you appoint her as the empress?

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:15.260
I don't fancy her.

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:18.090
You're my son.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:20.970
Do you think I can't tell the relationship

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:22.420
between you two?

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:23.090
Mother.

00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:29.490
According to ancestral rites,

00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:33.010
one must appoint an empress before performing the worship ritual.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:37.220
You have to appoint an empress as soon as possible.

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.570
I saw how she conducted herself today.

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.010
She can definitely handle the imperial harem without an issue.

00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:49.360
What's wrong? Are you worried about her?

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:54.340
I once suspected that she was on Marquis of Nanyan's side.

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:56.940
But she risked her life to rescue me on numerous occasions.

00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:59.530
She should be unrelated to Marquis of Nanyan.

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:00.820
It's just that there remains

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:04.450
an unsolved mystery about her.

00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:09.050
What unsolved mystery?

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:12.340
Actually, she has been

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.380
appearing in my dreams often since young.

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:19.970
Is that actually true?

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:25.220
If so, I'm sure Heaven

00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:29.940
has led you two together.

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.700
I've never believed in the existence of Heaven.

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:45.700
Given the current circumstances,

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:48.940
I understand why you're being cautious.

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.380
But in my opinion,

00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:55.050
sometimes,

00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:58.740
you have to open your heart and feel everything around you.

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:28.970
Kill him!

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:30.170
I do not kill.

00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:32.650
If he doesn't die, you'll die instead!

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:35.220
Even more people will die in the days to come!

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:36.700
Pull out the sword.

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:53.300
Do you remember what I taught you?

00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:56.220
Do it.

00:42:57.550 --> 00:42:59.090
Why must you force me to do this?

00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:06.380
Boss, why are you trying to scam me here?

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:13.130
No.

00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:28.050
I dreamt about her again.

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:33.180
[Ziquan Palace]

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:42.010
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:44.900
Dear, how's your wound?

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.490
The imperial physician already examined me. I'm fine.

00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:56.010
Why hasn't the wound healed as quickly this time,

00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:58.130
unlike before?

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:01.900
Fairies aren't omnipotent, you know?

00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:06.650
In tales of the supernatural,

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:09.450
fairies always love all living beings.

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:14.490
But you're only devoted to me.

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.010
You're devoted to one individual.

00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:25.260
Who exactly are you?

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:27.780
