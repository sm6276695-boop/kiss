Previously on
Seducing Drake Palma.

00:00:32.915 --> 00:00:34.937
You’re really avoiding me, huh?

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:40.851
Well, happy birthday.

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:43.509
Adobo was not just

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:44.802
- created for its flavor.
- [In French] Only you.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.402
- It was first created for survival.
- [In French] Happy birthday, Alys.

00:00:47.952 --> 00:00:49.117
What’s his deal?

00:00:49.515 --> 00:00:51.309
Miss Perez, anything
you want to add?

00:00:51.334 --> 00:00:52.869
[In French] Only you.

00:00:52.894 --> 00:00:53.811
Do you believe

00:00:54.145 --> 00:00:56.230
the number of girls I played with

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:59.192
would be the amount of times
you would cry because of someone?

00:00:59.708 --> 00:01:01.516
Oh no, what should I do?

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:05.323
Should I greet him, or just walk
straight like I didn’t see him?

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:07.533
What to do?

00:01:13.116 --> 00:01:17.298
♪ Happy birthday to you… ♪

00:01:23.508 --> 00:01:24.806
Oh, where’s Drake?

00:01:25.016 --> 00:01:26.016
Oh, uhm...

00:01:27.568 --> 00:01:28.568
On the way.

00:01:29.097 --> 00:01:30.223
He says he’s on the way.

00:01:31.281 --> 00:01:32.408
Where’s your escort?

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.181
He said he was
already on his way.

00:01:34.602 --> 00:01:35.186
Mom…

00:01:35.186 --> 00:01:36.729
The program is about to start.

00:01:36.865 --> 00:01:38.372
Mom, I don’t know.

00:01:38.397 --> 00:01:41.692
Actually I texted him a while ago,
and he said he’s already on the way.

00:01:42.527 --> 00:01:44.362
What did I do to deserve this, Drake?

00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:47.573
Why are you hurting me so badly?

00:01:47.907 --> 00:01:49.001
This can’t be!

00:01:49.033 --> 00:01:50.535
It’s my birthday today!

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.162
Don’t leave me.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.082
Do you understand
what you’re saying, Alys?

00:01:56.541 --> 00:02:00.545
If I go there,
I’ll make my joke real.

00:02:01.212 --> 00:02:02.475
I won’t leave you alone.

00:02:03.506 --> 00:02:06.303
This is supposed to be
the happiest night of my life.

00:02:06.843 --> 00:02:07.843
My debut.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.841
I don’t deserve this, Drake.

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:37.923
What do you need from me, Drake?

00:02:39.075 --> 00:02:40.285
Help me out, Tripp.

00:02:42.716 --> 00:02:44.384
I really messed up with Alys.

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:46.446
At least you know.

00:02:47.508 --> 00:02:48.551
So please,

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:51.040
I’m asking you as family—

00:02:51.444 --> 00:02:52.688
bring Alys here.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:57.940
Where are you taking me?

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:00.722
Just follow the light.

00:03:02.565 --> 00:03:04.692
He prepared that for you, Zyril.

00:03:50.363 --> 00:03:51.405
Happy birthday.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:54.909
Hopefully, I’m still not late.

00:04:18.474 --> 00:04:21.811
Sorry, I bailed on you.
Something just really came up.

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:27.483
Reasons, reasons, reasons.

00:04:28.776 --> 00:04:30.444
You always have a reason.

00:04:39.578 --> 00:04:40.589
Am I too late?

00:04:44.542 --> 00:04:45.542
You’re late.

00:04:48.754 --> 00:04:50.172
You’re way too late.

00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:53.091
You know why?

00:04:55.678 --> 00:04:57.596
Because you’ve hurt me too much.

00:05:02.518 --> 00:05:04.937
It’s too late to forgive you.

00:05:08.215 --> 00:05:09.567
I’m really sorry, Alys.

00:05:10.151 --> 00:05:12.480
I’m here now.
I’m already here, see.

00:05:14.238 --> 00:05:15.573
You don’t understand.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:18.451
I’m done.

00:05:19.452 --> 00:05:20.452
No.

00:05:20.703 --> 00:05:21.871
You’re just mad, Alys.

00:05:21.896 --> 00:05:23.272
I’m not mad, Drake.

00:05:24.727 --> 00:05:25.979
I’m hurting.

00:05:29.373 --> 00:05:30.504
Please hear me out.

00:05:32.006 --> 00:05:35.097
I just had to go.
I didn’t mean to leave you, Alys.

00:05:35.122 --> 00:05:36.832
How convenient.

00:05:37.678 --> 00:05:39.285
You’re always like that, Drake.

00:05:40.431 --> 00:05:43.392
Every time you hurt me,
you always have an excuse.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:45.853
Why are you like this?

00:05:48.022 --> 00:05:49.022
I don’t know.

00:05:51.777 --> 00:05:52.863
I’m just like this.

00:05:54.274 --> 00:05:56.819
Please try to understand me.
Bear with me.

00:05:57.281 --> 00:05:59.158
I’ve been understanding you, Drake.

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:01.577
Even back then.

00:06:04.246 --> 00:06:07.958
But now, it’s my turn
to be understood.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.941
I’m done.

00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:13.637
I thought you love me.

00:06:15.591 --> 00:06:18.426
What was that Alys?
Your personal version of joke?

00:06:19.053 --> 00:06:20.053
Drake...

00:06:22.223 --> 00:06:25.393
When I said I
loved you, I meant it.

00:06:26.435 --> 00:06:30.272
And now that I’m saying
I’m done, I mean that too.

00:06:30.272 --> 00:06:32.483
No! I won’t break up with you!

00:06:32.525 --> 00:06:34.944
It’s not even an option
anymore for you, Drake!

00:06:37.655 --> 00:06:38.660
We’re done!

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:46.090
I love you, Alys.

00:06:50.418 --> 00:06:51.426
I love you.

00:06:53.421 --> 00:06:54.421
Please, don’t go.

00:06:55.756 --> 00:06:57.174
I don’t want to get hurt again.

00:07:00.829 --> 00:07:01.829
Please.

00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:08.644
Drake, I love you,
you know that.

00:07:10.896 --> 00:07:15.651
But if that love will keep hurting me,

00:07:16.576 --> 00:07:17.952
then I don’t want it anymore.

00:07:20.322 --> 00:07:21.322
I’m tired.

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:25.244
I’m done.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:38.590
Enough.

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:40.659
I’m done.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.531
Tripp...

00:09:44.425 --> 00:09:48.512
I love you, Drake Palma!

00:09:54.018 --> 00:09:55.644
I’m done.

00:09:57.187 --> 00:09:58.188
I thought you love me.

00:09:59.273 --> 00:10:02.359
When I said I
loved you, I meant it.

00:10:03.569 --> 00:10:07.406
And now that I’m saying
I’m done, I mean that too.

00:10:07.406 --> 00:10:09.617
No! I won’t break up with you!

00:10:09.658 --> 00:10:11.910
It’s not even an option
anymore for you, Drake!

00:10:14.788 --> 00:10:15.813
We’re done!

00:10:43.484 --> 00:10:44.484
How’s the single life?

00:10:45.569 --> 00:10:46.569
It’s been a week.

00:10:48.155 --> 00:10:49.155
How is it?

00:10:49.615 --> 00:10:50.716
It’s like this.

00:10:50.741 --> 00:10:51.749
Ouch!

00:10:52.147 --> 00:10:52.785
- What?
- That hurts.

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:53.636
How does it feel?

00:10:53.661 --> 00:10:54.694
Does it hurt?

00:10:57.456 --> 00:10:58.456
Is it hard?

00:11:00.619 --> 00:11:01.619
Yes.

00:11:03.962 --> 00:11:04.962
But you know what,

00:11:07.289 --> 00:11:09.947
when I remember all the times
he’s forgotten about me,

00:11:12.346 --> 00:11:15.766
I think maybe it’s
better this way—

00:11:17.935 --> 00:11:19.144
that we broke up.

00:11:20.604 --> 00:11:22.064
At least...

00:11:23.107 --> 00:11:24.441
there are no expectations,

00:11:25.987 --> 00:11:27.239
no disappointments.

00:11:39.832 --> 00:11:40.966
They’re so sweet.

00:11:41.041 --> 00:11:42.942
Looks like the guy’s
lucky with his girlfriend.

00:11:44.044 --> 00:11:45.059
I hope everyone has that.

00:11:47.673 --> 00:11:50.544
Tripp, why don’t you
have a girlfriend yet?

00:11:51.314 --> 00:11:53.066
It’s impossible, right?

00:11:53.444 --> 00:11:55.988
This punk’s got the charm.

00:11:56.306 --> 00:11:57.325
Well, I don’t know.

00:11:58.016 --> 00:12:00.778
I mean, I’m handsome—
but I don’t know.

00:12:02.479 --> 00:12:04.523
You’re so full of yourself!

00:12:05.649 --> 00:12:08.247
Why? I really am handsome—
what can I do?

00:12:08.819 --> 00:12:10.520
Fine, Tripp’s handsome!

00:12:10.904 --> 00:12:12.281
I’ll admit that!

00:12:12.823 --> 00:12:15.809
That’s why the girls here in
Brenford pick fights with me.

00:12:16.785 --> 00:12:19.329
And since Drake and I broke up,

00:12:19.621 --> 00:12:21.540
it’s really Tripp who’s
been helping me.

00:12:23.667 --> 00:12:24.708
Whatever you say.

00:12:25.502 --> 00:12:26.795
You’re my boss, after all.

00:12:31.245 --> 00:12:33.580
Zy, honestly,

00:12:34.386 --> 00:12:37.497
I haven’t had a girlfriend
because I’m not sure yet.

00:12:40.225 --> 00:12:45.063
But when I do,
she’ll be happy for sure.

00:12:47.524 --> 00:12:49.755
Because like my camera,

00:12:50.652 --> 00:12:52.362
I’ll only point my lens at her.

00:13:06.224 --> 00:13:07.601
I’m pretty, right?

00:13:09.379 --> 00:13:11.458
Yes, you’re pretty.

00:13:12.716 --> 00:13:14.551
You might end up crying.

00:13:21.433 --> 00:13:22.848
Um, shall we go?

00:13:23.185 --> 00:13:24.223
Where are we going?

00:13:24.645 --> 00:13:27.022
Where do you want to go?

00:13:27.689 --> 00:13:28.770
Let’s go to SCA.

00:13:30.526 --> 00:13:31.568
SCA, really?

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:32.536
Ouch!

00:13:32.653 --> 00:13:35.489
Didn’t you say you’d do everything
so Drake and I won’t get back together?

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.388
But it feels like you’re
pushing me back to him.

00:13:40.244 --> 00:13:41.302
So, what is it really?

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.614
I was just joking.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.333
You’re so hot-headed.

00:13:47.918 --> 00:13:49.353
Come on, let’s grab coffee.

00:13:49.378 --> 00:13:50.437
To cool things down.

00:13:50.462 --> 00:13:51.481
Let’s go.

00:13:52.256 --> 00:13:53.466
You’re so persistent.

00:13:53.491 --> 00:13:54.497
Let’s go.

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:02.700
Try avoiding him when you can.

00:14:03.649 --> 00:14:04.817
Tripp, please!

00:14:05.102 --> 00:14:06.458
No more Drake-talks, okay?

00:14:06.687 --> 00:14:08.021
I’m moving on!

00:14:09.314 --> 00:14:10.499
Got it, boss!

00:14:10.524 --> 00:14:11.750
Here, stay with me.

00:14:11.775 --> 00:14:12.950
Hide behind me.

00:14:14.111 --> 00:14:15.763
Hide there so he won’t see you.

00:14:17.267 --> 00:14:20.247
And if he sees you,
I’ve got you.

00:14:21.702 --> 00:14:22.911
As long as you treat me, okay?

00:14:24.246 --> 00:14:25.706
Wow, you’ve got some nerve!

00:14:26.039 --> 00:14:27.057
Why?

00:14:27.082 --> 00:14:29.960
Whenever I’m with you,
I’ll really end up starving to death.

00:14:30.586 --> 00:14:32.671
And I’m the girl here—why
am I the one treating you?

00:14:32.963 --> 00:14:35.007
What’s wrong with you? You’re the guy—
you’re supposed to treat me!

00:14:35.048 --> 00:14:36.800
I’ll pawn your camera
so you can treat me!

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:37.776
Hey, no!

00:14:37.801 --> 00:14:39.114
- Whatever.
- Not this one. I love this.

00:14:39.167 --> 00:14:40.237
You’re so annoying!

00:14:40.262 --> 00:14:41.071
Come on, treat me!

00:14:41.096 --> 00:14:41.822
I don’t want to!

00:14:41.847 --> 00:14:42.614
Alys!

00:14:42.639 --> 00:14:44.349
I don’t know with you, Tripp!
Tell me the truth,

00:14:44.349 --> 00:14:45.458
- don’t you have allowance?
- Zyril!

00:14:45.851 --> 00:14:46.435
What?!

00:14:46.476 --> 00:14:47.477
You don’t want to, Alys, huh?

00:14:47.477 --> 00:14:49.605
Zyril, treat me.

00:14:49.646 --> 00:14:50.814
Quit it, Tripp!

00:14:51.023 --> 00:14:52.624
I’m asking just this once.

00:14:52.649 --> 00:14:54.692
Just this once?
It’s every day!

00:14:54.717 --> 00:14:56.295
What do you mean
every day—come on!

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.280
- Ugh! I can’t with you!
- I left my allowance!

00:14:58.322 --> 00:14:59.458
You left it?

00:14:59.489 --> 00:15:00.699
- Then have it delivered here.
- Yes, I left it.

00:15:00.699 --> 00:15:01.909
- Hey, you’re in the wrong lane.
- I said I don’t want to!

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:03.348
Stay right, come on.

00:15:07.748 --> 00:15:09.099
Your treat really hits different!

00:15:09.124 --> 00:15:11.293
What treat?
You forced me to.

00:15:11.335 --> 00:15:13.979
You didn’t even have money,
but you ordered endlessly.

00:15:14.004 --> 00:15:16.673
Hey, I have some.
I just left my wallet at home.

00:15:17.841 --> 00:15:20.677
You know what,
you’re such a freeloader.

00:15:20.844 --> 00:15:21.970
That’s why you don’t
have a girlfriend.

00:15:22.054 --> 00:15:22.846
Ouch!

00:15:22.888 --> 00:15:23.655
That hurts!

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.682
That’s way below
the belt, Miss Zyril!

00:15:26.934 --> 00:15:30.062
You’re single because
you’re a mooch.

00:15:30.312 --> 00:15:31.855
You don’t know how
to court a girl.

00:15:31.904 --> 00:15:32.997
- Tripp!
- Hey!

00:15:33.899 --> 00:15:35.651
- Tripp, hello!
- Here comes the octopus.

00:15:37.527 --> 00:15:39.613
You didn’t even visit
me in the hospital.

00:15:39.863 --> 00:15:41.949
I thought we were friends.

00:15:44.368 --> 00:15:45.619
The octopus attacks again.

00:15:47.079 --> 00:15:48.205
Please, Shaira, not here.

00:15:49.915 --> 00:15:50.973
Oh.

00:15:51.833 --> 00:15:55.796
Alys, you’re here.
I didn’t notice you.

00:15:56.129 --> 00:15:57.137
My bad.

00:15:59.925 --> 00:16:03.637
By the way, I heard
you and Drake broke up.

00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:08.392
I’m so sorry to hear…for you.

00:16:08.558 --> 00:16:10.723
Definitely happy for me.

00:16:14.605 --> 00:16:17.673
I didn’t break up with
Drake so you could have him.

00:16:17.698 --> 00:16:19.241
You’re forever shameless.

00:16:20.237 --> 00:16:21.546
What did you just say?

00:16:21.571 --> 00:16:22.622
Hmm?

00:16:23.699 --> 00:16:25.158
Shaira, leave us alone.

00:16:26.368 --> 00:16:29.037
And also, get some rest.

00:16:29.062 --> 00:16:31.899
You just got out of the hospital
and you’re wandering around.

00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:34.126
And fix your attitude.

00:16:37.879 --> 00:16:38.895
Fine.

00:16:39.545 --> 00:16:40.575
If you say so.

00:16:41.258 --> 00:16:42.592
I’ll go now, Tripp, okay?

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:44.778
Bye.

00:16:51.059 --> 00:16:53.228
That’s insane.
That squid is so flirty.

00:16:53.603 --> 00:16:55.105
She clings like a leech!

00:16:57.232 --> 00:16:58.286
Hey you, Tripp!

00:16:59.615 --> 00:17:01.367
What’s going on
between you and Shaira?

00:17:02.696 --> 00:17:03.856
What is she to you, anyway?

00:17:05.365 --> 00:17:07.247
Hey, watch your answer.

00:17:07.825 --> 00:17:11.036
For all I know, you’re friends
and you’re just messing with me.

00:17:13.081 --> 00:17:15.042
You wouldn’t do that
to me, right, Tripp?

00:17:16.293 --> 00:17:17.227
Hey, Tripp!

00:17:17.252 --> 00:17:19.212
What’s really going on with
you and Shaira?

00:17:22.966 --> 00:17:24.259
I courted her before.

00:17:25.552 --> 00:17:28.513
You know, I got rejected
because of Drake.

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:34.840
Hold on.

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:38.731
I thought you hadn’t
courted anyone before?

00:17:39.024 --> 00:17:42.277
Of course, I’d lose some charm points
if I tell people I got rejected.

00:17:43.111 --> 00:17:44.434
Let’s keep that our secret, okay?

00:17:46.198 --> 00:17:47.282
But even so,

00:17:49.409 --> 00:17:51.286
you’re still on my side, right?

00:17:52.496 --> 00:17:53.528
Of course!

00:17:53.955 --> 00:17:55.123
You’re still my boss.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.087
Damn it! You’re so cute!

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:03.090
I could cry! I wanna
put you in my pocket!

00:18:03.465 --> 00:18:04.925
You’d make a great keychain!

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:07.090
Go ahead.
You can even take me home.

00:18:09.054 --> 00:18:10.083
Annoying.

00:18:11.973 --> 00:18:13.350
I’ll take this, you’re not
even going to eat it.

00:18:13.375 --> 00:18:14.402
You can have it.

00:18:24.027 --> 00:18:24.920
Okay.

00:18:24.945 --> 00:18:25.981
Oh.

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:41.812
There.

00:18:41.837 --> 00:18:42.973
You’re smart, right?

00:18:49.693 --> 00:18:51.387
Mmm, you got this!

00:18:59.521 --> 00:19:00.551
What now?

00:19:00.856 --> 00:19:02.200
You’ve got flour on your face.

00:19:06.486 --> 00:19:07.629
So grumpy.

00:19:14.077 --> 00:19:15.770
Ouch! What now?

00:19:15.871 --> 00:19:17.289
Oh, sorry.

00:19:17.927 --> 00:19:18.965
I didn’t mean to.

00:19:22.544 --> 00:19:24.129
Hey, why are you taking my cake?!

00:19:24.171 --> 00:19:24.911
Give it to me.

00:19:25.213 --> 00:19:26.481
Are you serious?!

00:19:26.506 --> 00:19:27.883
This is mine!
I’m bringing it home!

00:19:27.908 --> 00:19:29.702
This is mine.
Just make another one!

00:19:29.727 --> 00:19:31.062
No way, this is mine!

00:19:31.087 --> 00:19:31.862
It’s mine now!

00:19:31.887 --> 00:19:32.942
No, it’s mine!

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:39.311
Oh, Alys.

00:19:40.187 --> 00:19:42.147
You are broken up, okay?
Move on already.

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:47.527
Alys, the oven has been
beeping for awhile now.

00:19:47.569 --> 00:19:48.301
Oh!

00:19:48.564 --> 00:19:49.606
Okay, hold on.

00:20:03.481 --> 00:20:04.878
Alys, your baking!

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.296
Oh, I got it.

00:20:15.388 --> 00:20:17.515
Wow, those look gorgeous!

00:20:18.516 --> 00:20:20.645
Exactly, I want to
take some home

00:20:21.019 --> 00:20:25.565
because my brother is
heading back to the States.

00:20:26.024 --> 00:20:27.379
I wanted to bring him some.

00:20:27.943 --> 00:20:29.152
Then, take one.

00:20:29.402 --> 00:20:30.762
They won’t even notice.

00:20:31.112 --> 00:20:32.364
Girl, seriously!

00:20:32.489 --> 00:20:35.784
Those are for the street
kids our culinary class feeds.

00:20:35.995 --> 00:20:37.465
I’ll just make them a new batch.

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:39.629
Okay.

00:20:51.424 --> 00:20:53.343
Oh, Aunt Liana?

00:20:53.677 --> 00:20:54.678
Why is she calling?

00:20:55.637 --> 00:20:56.668
Hello?

00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:58.682
Alys, honey?

00:20:59.849 --> 00:21:01.340
Hi, Aunt Liana!

00:21:01.726 --> 00:21:03.061
What made you call?

00:21:03.853 --> 00:21:05.397
Kiddo, are you done with class?

00:21:05.563 --> 00:21:06.778
We’re picking you up.

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:10.610
Why, Aunt?
Are you with Daddy?

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:12.112
Yes, I’m with your dad.

00:21:12.487 --> 00:21:15.448
We’re close to Brenford,
so we’ll be there in a few.

00:21:15.907 --> 00:21:17.993
Okay, Aunt. I’ll just tell Mom.

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:21.496
I already told your
mom about this surprise.

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:23.707
We’ll be there in 15 minutes.

00:21:24.541 --> 00:21:25.542
Okay, Aunt.

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:27.723
See you!

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:32.465
I wonder what surprise
Aunt Liana is talking about.

00:21:34.384 --> 00:21:36.678
I was planning to go
to the park with Tripp.

00:21:37.053 --> 00:21:38.847
Alright, whatever.
I’ll just head home early.

00:21:42.642 --> 00:21:45.684
Tripp, I’ll go ahead.

00:21:45.937 --> 00:21:47.689
Good luck on your recits!

00:21:50.984 --> 00:21:54.237
What surprise is Aunt
Liana talking about?

00:21:54.904 --> 00:21:56.281
She says it’s a surprise.

00:21:58.491 --> 00:21:59.676
Surprise!

00:22:01.494 --> 00:22:04.289
We’re so excited about this,
kiddo. Right, Cy?

00:22:04.497 --> 00:22:05.535
Yeah, of course!

00:22:06.833 --> 00:22:08.488
Wait, what’s this surprise?

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:10.879
My birthday’s already over.

00:22:11.463 --> 00:22:13.131
My graduation is still far off.

00:22:13.548 --> 00:22:14.548
There!

00:22:18.928 --> 00:22:20.043
Oh my god!

00:22:20.638 --> 00:22:23.850
Aunt, Daddy, don’t tell me...

00:22:24.642 --> 00:22:26.353
What do you want
for your birthday?

00:22:27.354 --> 00:22:31.191
Aunt Liana, do you think you could
convince Dad to get me a condo?

00:22:32.442 --> 00:22:33.126
Condo?

00:22:33.151 --> 00:22:33.860
Mhm!

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:34.919
Why?

00:22:34.944 --> 00:22:36.387
I just wanna live next to Drake.

00:22:37.697 --> 00:22:39.407
Oh my gosh!

00:22:42.577 --> 00:22:43.684
Are you ready?

00:22:47.503 --> 00:22:49.213
- Good morning.
- Hi.

00:22:53.903 --> 00:22:56.489
Lord, let it not be 19th floor.

00:22:56.894 --> 00:23:00.527
Lord, not 19th floor.

00:23:00.637 --> 00:23:01.965
Are you okay, Alys?

00:23:02.918 --> 00:23:03.957
Yes, Aunt.

00:23:15.944 --> 00:23:18.571
Oh my gosh. It’s in
19th floor, too.

00:23:20.073 --> 00:23:21.825
Hey, is there a problem?

00:23:22.909 --> 00:23:24.199
Oh, nothing, Daddy.

00:23:25.578 --> 00:23:28.373
I’m so excited!
Aren’t you, Alys?

00:23:28.498 --> 00:23:30.708
Of course, Aunt.
I’m very excited, too.

00:23:32.752 --> 00:23:34.170
Gosh!

00:23:39.467 --> 00:23:40.473
Let’s go.

00:23:42.011 --> 00:23:44.180
Lord, I hope he’s not here, please.

00:23:45.432 --> 00:23:46.850
Um, Dad?

00:23:47.059 --> 00:23:47.517
Yeah?

00:23:47.559 --> 00:23:49.202
Why are you going there?

00:23:49.227 --> 00:23:50.340
Isn’t it here?

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:52.897
Honey, over here.

00:23:53.189 --> 00:23:54.223
Oh, sorry.

00:23:54.339 --> 00:23:55.340
Let’s go.

00:23:56.734 --> 00:23:58.236
I’m really getting old.

00:24:00.071 --> 00:24:03.408
Lord, we’re on the same floor.

00:24:03.575 --> 00:24:07.370
Alys, I really insisted that
Cy should buy you this unit.

00:24:08.618 --> 00:24:09.590
The Cove Tower?

00:24:10.165 --> 00:24:11.254
Yes!

00:24:11.499 --> 00:24:12.834
This is a nice condo.

00:24:12.859 --> 00:24:13.601
Yes!

00:24:13.626 --> 00:24:18.798
I hope Dad or Daddy or anyone
agrees, I just really want a condo!

00:24:20.091 --> 00:24:23.761
Lord, I knew it. Be careful what
you wish for ‘cause you just might get it.

00:24:24.762 --> 00:24:28.391
0-7-2-1. That’s just
the temporary passcode, okay?

00:24:28.725 --> 00:24:30.061
You can change it later.

00:24:30.086 --> 00:24:31.835
But remember it, okay.
You might not get in.

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:33.342
You know the passcode.

00:24:34.228 --> 00:24:36.147
I have short-term memory loss.

00:24:36.187 --> 00:24:37.499
I forgot it already.

00:24:47.535 --> 00:24:50.788
Stand there until you remember.

00:24:52.373 --> 00:24:53.373
What?

00:24:56.169 --> 00:24:57.061
Drake!

00:24:57.094 --> 00:24:58.100
Drake!

00:25:00.298 --> 00:25:01.298
Okay.

00:25:02.349 --> 00:25:03.349
Let’s go.

00:25:15.788 --> 00:25:17.540
Welcome to your unit!

00:25:17.565 --> 00:25:19.859
My gosh, it’s so pink!

00:25:20.527 --> 00:25:22.403
And the strawberries!

00:25:23.196 --> 00:25:24.322
- Wow!
- You like it?

00:25:24.322 --> 00:25:25.865
I love it!

00:25:25.865 --> 00:25:28.993
Thank you so much, Aunt!
Thank you so much, Daddy!

00:25:29.035 --> 00:25:30.411
You’re welcome, kiddo!

00:25:30.411 --> 00:25:31.592
Anything for you, dear.

00:25:31.955 --> 00:25:32.997
Thank you.

00:25:33.039 --> 00:25:36.417
I hope you don’t mind – we
already bought some of your things.

00:25:36.626 --> 00:25:37.811
I don’t mind at all.

00:25:38.836 --> 00:25:42.256
And also, if you want to
move in, you can start tonight.

00:25:42.674 --> 00:25:43.424
Really?

00:25:43.424 --> 00:25:44.025
Yup!

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:45.510
I asked permission from your mom.

00:25:45.552 --> 00:25:48.471
But first, you’ll need to
grab your stuff.

00:25:48.513 --> 00:25:49.347
- Okay?
- Yes.

00:25:49.347 --> 00:25:50.298
Okay.

00:25:50.323 --> 00:25:51.032
Great! Excited?

00:25:51.057 --> 00:25:52.225
Yes, very excited!

00:25:52.976 --> 00:25:53.977
Good!

00:25:54.811 --> 00:25:56.312
Thank you so much!

00:25:56.354 --> 00:25:58.898
Wow, guys, you
really know my taste!

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:01.901
This is such a pleasant surprise.
Thank you so much. I love you.

00:26:02.777 --> 00:26:04.779
I love you, Aunt, Daddy!

00:26:08.774 --> 00:26:09.900
Thank you, Dad.

00:26:14.664 --> 00:26:17.166
Alys, be responsible.

00:26:17.458 --> 00:26:18.017
Yes, Mom.

00:26:18.042 --> 00:26:19.061
I doubt it.

00:26:19.168 --> 00:26:20.795
You’re always contradicting.

00:26:21.296 --> 00:26:25.383
Well, just don’t do anything
that will put you in danger.

00:26:25.883 --> 00:26:26.913
Yes, Mom.

00:26:26.968 --> 00:26:29.137
Come on, your daughter’s
18 now. She’s a grown up.

00:26:30.138 --> 00:26:32.890
It’s just sad, our
house will feel so empty.

00:26:33.725 --> 00:26:36.477
Don’t be too sad, Mom,
I’m just a tumble away.

00:26:36.853 --> 00:26:38.688
And I’ll be here on weekends.

00:26:38.938 --> 00:26:40.655
Mom, if you want, I’ll stay.

00:26:41.258 --> 00:26:45.155
No, because you won’t
change anyway if you stay here.

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:49.913
Oh, by the way, I’ll come with
you to the airport when you leave.

00:26:50.283 --> 00:26:51.827
Stop reminding
me that I’m leaving.

00:26:52.327 --> 00:26:53.671
Alright, it’s getting late.

00:26:53.953 --> 00:26:55.121
- We’ll go.
- Okay.

00:26:59.292 --> 00:27:00.319
Mom...

00:27:01.919 --> 00:27:04.839
It’s okay.
I’ll be okay, I promise.

00:27:05.173 --> 00:27:06.194
Okay, honey.

00:27:20.521 --> 00:27:23.232
Good morning, Alys Zyril Perez!

00:27:25.026 --> 00:27:26.444
It’s a brand new day.

00:27:27.283 --> 00:27:29.159
Day one of being independent.

00:27:30.114 --> 00:27:37.288
So, you don’t have a cook, no cleaner, no
babysitter, but you got this.

00:27:40.917 --> 00:27:41.917
Aja!

00:27:44.527 --> 00:27:45.980
7:00 A.M.

00:27:46.005 --> 00:27:49.258
I know Drake’s first
class is at 7:00 A.M.

00:27:49.283 --> 00:27:55.960
So, he’ll leave by 6:30, since
it’s 15 minutes travel from here to SCA.

00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:59.977
Perfect, I still have time
to grab breakfast outside.

00:28:00.269 --> 00:28:01.896
Way to go, Alys!

00:28:06.776 --> 00:28:07.776
Good morning, Alys.

00:28:10.446 --> 00:28:11.823
Lord, I knew it,

00:28:11.864 --> 00:28:14.467
I should never have
wished for a condo!

00:28:14.992 --> 00:28:16.460
I take my wish back.

00:28:17.328 --> 00:28:18.499
Have you eaten your breakfast?

00:28:18.996 --> 00:28:20.772
We haven’t seen
each other for a week.

00:28:21.624 --> 00:28:24.419
But no! You’re
already broken up, Alys.

00:28:24.711 --> 00:28:26.379
Don’t forget that.

00:28:26.515 --> 00:28:27.605
Let’s eat.

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:28.655
I just ate.

00:28:33.182 --> 00:28:35.335
Why does it have to be now?!

00:28:37.306 --> 00:28:38.306
Let’s eat!

00:28:40.643 --> 00:28:41.643
I don’t want to.

00:28:46.399 --> 00:28:50.486
Drake, we’ve been
broken up for a week.

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:53.072
One week, you know that?

00:28:54.407 --> 00:28:58.411
You didn’t even make an effort to call
me or talk to me during that entire week.

00:28:59.162 --> 00:29:01.914
Then now, you just show up
and invite me for breakfast?

00:29:03.291 --> 00:29:06.127
Drake, are you okay?

00:29:06.878 --> 00:29:07.889
I gave you time.

00:29:08.296 --> 00:29:11.007
Why? Did I ask for time?

00:29:15.137 --> 00:29:16.137
I’m sorry.

00:29:17.575 --> 00:29:18.575
It’s my fault.

00:29:20.349 --> 00:29:22.428
Now, will you eat
breakfast with me?

00:29:25.313 --> 00:29:26.327
Good morning, Zy!

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:30.280
Tripp! What are you doing here?

00:29:30.651 --> 00:29:32.570
And how did you
even know where I live?

00:29:34.489 --> 00:29:36.282
Aunt Liana told me.

00:29:36.949 --> 00:29:39.366
It’s funny, it’s like she was
setting you up with me.

00:29:41.954 --> 00:29:44.499
Hey, cousin, you’re here.

00:29:47.126 --> 00:29:49.725
Uh, Zy, have you eaten yet?

00:29:53.758 --> 00:29:55.109
What’s your passcode?

00:29:55.134 --> 00:29:56.217
Come on, let’s eat.

00:30:00.598 --> 00:30:02.600
Zy! What’s your passcode?

00:30:02.892 --> 00:30:05.381
No, this can’t be happening.

00:30:05.937 --> 00:30:08.564
Come on, I’m not a burglar!

00:30:09.565 --> 00:30:11.819
Even if I knew your passcode,
I wouldn’t just barge in!

00:30:12.109 --> 00:30:13.319
That’s not it!

00:30:13.694 --> 00:30:14.913
Come here,
I’ll whisper it to you.

00:30:19.575 --> 00:30:21.661
What?! I can’t hear you.

00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:27.303
What?

00:30:27.356 --> 00:30:28.421
1131?

00:30:28.718 --> 00:30:30.302
Why did you shout it out?

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:31.670
Ouch.

00:30:38.469 --> 00:30:41.013
He’s probably thinking
I haven’t moved on yet.

00:30:44.684 --> 00:30:45.702
Come on, Zy!

00:30:47.872 --> 00:30:48.830
Alys.

00:30:48.855 --> 00:30:50.064
Drake and I are over.

00:30:50.648 --> 00:30:52.436
Tripp’s the one
always with me now.

00:30:53.067 --> 00:30:54.694
So who else would I choose?

00:30:55.194 --> 00:30:56.295
Can I come in, too?

00:30:58.322 --> 00:30:59.448
Don’t you have a class?

00:30:59.448 --> 00:31:00.448
I’ll ditch.

00:31:00.791 --> 00:31:02.725
Hey, don’t ditch.
Go to your class.

00:31:06.038 --> 00:31:07.123
Do you hate me that much?

00:31:09.792 --> 00:31:10.685
Huh?

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:13.772
I just want to spend time with you,
but you keep on pushing me away.

00:31:14.791 --> 00:31:16.084
Alys, are we really over?

00:31:17.083 --> 00:31:22.194
Drake, if you really want to
talk to me, can we just do it tonight?

00:31:22.706 --> 00:31:24.207
Let’s have dinner together.

00:31:25.266 --> 00:31:28.060
I don’t want you skipping
class because of me, okay?

00:31:29.478 --> 00:31:30.478
Dinner date, then.

00:31:40.031 --> 00:31:41.532
I miss you so much, Alys.

00:31:43.618 --> 00:31:44.702
God, Lord...

00:31:45.828 --> 00:31:49.665
Why are my palpitations weak now?
It’s a little less.

00:31:50.041 --> 00:31:51.522
It’s only tame palpitations.

00:31:52.627 --> 00:31:53.961
I miss you, too.

00:31:59.508 --> 00:32:00.569
I’ll go ahead.

00:32:01.844 --> 00:32:04.311
Be careful with my cousin.
I know him.

00:32:20.488 --> 00:32:21.488
Alys!

00:32:22.031 --> 00:32:23.975
What now?
Did you guys get back together?

00:32:28.579 --> 00:32:29.579
You know too much!

00:32:30.581 --> 00:32:33.811
What the heck, you ruined my hair.
It was perfectly fixed.

00:32:41.717 --> 00:32:44.428
Lord, why does he
have to be so handsome?

00:32:45.179 --> 00:32:48.334
Okay fine, I’ll admit it, he’s
even more handsome than Drake.

00:32:48.891 --> 00:32:49.934
This is so hard!

00:32:53.062 --> 00:32:55.690
So, you and Drake
are talking again, huh?

00:32:57.938 --> 00:32:59.106
Are you getting back together?

00:33:00.111 --> 00:33:01.513
You’re asking too much.

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:03.906
I just want to know.

00:33:04.699 --> 00:33:07.052
Why? Are you jealous?

00:33:12.841 --> 00:33:13.841
Kind of.

00:33:17.044 --> 00:33:18.044
Maybe.

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:25.136
Whatever.

00:33:26.182 --> 00:33:27.489
I still have class.

00:33:28.061 --> 00:33:29.771
How about you,
don’t you have class?

00:33:30.726 --> 00:33:31.816
What time is your class?

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:33.260
10:00 AM.

00:33:34.145 --> 00:33:36.536
10:00 AM. Okay, ride with me.

00:33:37.106 --> 00:33:38.290
I brought my car.

00:33:38.315 --> 00:33:40.126
Of course, I’ll ride with you.

00:33:40.151 --> 00:33:41.325
Are you a boarder here?

00:33:42.528 --> 00:33:44.071
Come on, eat so we can leave.

00:33:44.113 --> 00:33:44.922
Wow, sweet!

00:33:44.947 --> 00:33:46.466
Hurry up, or we’ll be late!

00:33:52.621 --> 00:33:56.142
Zy, do you think I should
transfer to your building,

00:33:56.167 --> 00:33:57.825
so we’ll be wonder neighborhood?

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:00.435
Fine, yes!

00:34:01.081 --> 00:34:03.858
Because if I say no,
you might sulk again.

00:34:03.883 --> 00:34:05.801
No, really! I’m serious.

00:34:06.385 --> 00:34:07.458
What do you think?

00:34:07.511 --> 00:34:10.347
Mmm, but the octopus is there, too!

00:34:10.514 --> 00:34:11.802
That would be risky.

00:34:11.891 --> 00:34:15.327
Who knows, it won’t be just a touch
on the shoulder that will happen.

00:34:15.352 --> 00:34:16.996
That’s gross to even think about!

00:34:17.021 --> 00:34:21.776
No, just stay at your house.
So we can have world peace for all of us.

00:34:25.237 --> 00:34:30.785
Again, class, “mise en place”
means “everything in its place.”

00:34:31.452 --> 00:34:33.871
It is a French culinary theory

00:34:34.288 --> 00:34:40.127
emphasizing preparation and
organization before cooking.

00:34:41.921 --> 00:34:45.132
So, we need to determine
who’s the best among them.

00:34:45.722 --> 00:34:47.376
Can’t we just bake or something?

00:34:47.676 --> 00:34:49.149
Why is there even theory involved?

00:34:53.557 --> 00:34:54.557
What time is it?

00:34:58.312 --> 00:34:59.396
It’s still a long time!

00:34:59.872 --> 00:35:01.624
I need to be home by 2:00 P.M.

00:35:01.649 --> 00:35:03.901
I can’t miss sending
Dane to the airport!

00:35:04.792 --> 00:35:05.753
Ugh!

00:35:05.778 --> 00:35:09.990
So, to check if you
understood the lesson,

00:35:10.574 --> 00:35:16.330
let us test your mise en place
skills with a simple salad dish.

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:21.786
So, class, be ready
with your salad dish.

00:35:24.713 --> 00:35:25.809
Salad dish?

00:35:25.834 --> 00:35:27.290
Okay, where are the vegetables?

00:35:30.719 --> 00:35:31.804
Baby Dane!

00:35:31.846 --> 00:35:33.639
- You know, I rushed just to–
- So noisy!

00:35:34.557 --> 00:35:36.826
Hey, why are you
in such a bad mood?

00:35:36.851 --> 00:35:38.689
None of your business!
Why are you here?

00:35:39.353 --> 00:35:40.729
Duh! Obviously,
we’re taking you to the–

00:35:40.771 --> 00:35:42.164
I’m not a kid anymore!

00:35:42.189 --> 00:35:44.314
I don’t need to be
taken to the airport!

00:35:45.276 --> 00:35:46.360
Hey, Dane!

00:35:46.402 --> 00:35:47.376
Stop it, Alys!

00:35:48.279 --> 00:35:49.338
Dane!

00:35:49.363 --> 00:35:50.363
Dane!

00:35:51.782 --> 00:35:52.782
Dad!

00:35:53.951 --> 00:35:55.774
Dad, what happened to Dane?

00:35:55.995 --> 00:36:00.291
I even rushed my quiz just to catch
him here, then he just snapped at me!

00:36:00.316 --> 00:36:02.103
Just let it go, he got busted.

00:36:02.501 --> 00:36:05.104
Huh? Dane got busted?

00:36:05.129 --> 00:36:07.649
Felice came by,
worried about him,

00:36:07.882 --> 00:36:09.692
so don’t tell him you know, okay.

00:36:09.717 --> 00:36:10.892
That’ll just piss him off more.

00:36:11.177 --> 00:36:12.261
Poor thing.

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:20.895
Poor baby Dane,
rejected by his first love.

00:36:22.104 --> 00:36:23.782
Fine, I won’t tease him for now.

00:36:25.482 --> 00:36:26.642
Poor baby.

00:36:28.986 --> 00:36:30.196
Be good, okay?

00:36:30.196 --> 00:36:31.405
Listen to your Nana!

00:36:31.447 --> 00:36:32.493
- Alright, Mom.
- Alright?

00:36:34.783 --> 00:36:36.368
Be careful there, okay?

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:37.446
Don’t be stubborn.

00:36:38.037 --> 00:36:39.037
I will.

00:36:39.986 --> 00:36:42.353
Sorry for yelling at you earlier.

00:36:42.833 --> 00:36:46.295
It’s okay. I understand.

00:36:47.463 --> 00:36:48.631
I know the feeling.

00:36:50.216 --> 00:36:52.551
Everything will be fine.
Things will get better.

00:36:53.344 --> 00:36:55.064
If I can do it, you can, too.

00:36:56.055 --> 00:36:57.932
Wow, you really are
more mature than me.

00:36:59.516 --> 00:37:00.735
Take care there, okay?

00:37:01.268 --> 00:37:02.353
I’ll miss you.

00:37:03.812 --> 00:37:05.345
I will. I’ll be back.

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.376
Hon, we’ll go ahead.

00:37:09.401 --> 00:37:11.048
Alright. Take care, okay?

00:37:11.654 --> 00:37:13.939
Hey, Dane, you listen.

00:37:14.615 --> 00:37:15.681
Alys…

00:37:25.709 --> 00:37:26.709
Bye.

00:37:39.598 --> 00:37:41.058
There’s no one to
bother us anymore.

00:37:41.637 --> 00:37:43.430
Alys has her own life now.

00:37:44.353 --> 00:37:46.728
Wow, Dad, so dramatic!

00:37:47.314 --> 00:37:49.441
Alys, how’s living alone?

00:37:50.609 --> 00:37:51.985
Uh, it’s okay.

00:37:52.736 --> 00:37:54.173
Still getting used to it.

00:37:54.446 --> 00:37:55.962
Mmm, you’ll manage.

00:37:56.615 --> 00:37:59.451
Oh, by the way, no
monkey business!

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:01.485
What do you mean,
“monkey business”?

00:38:01.537 --> 00:38:02.876
If only you knew, bre–

00:38:04.039 --> 00:38:07.960
I mean, Mom, I swear, there’s
no monkey businesses going on.

00:38:08.002 --> 00:38:10.421
And how did you find out
that Drake’s my neighbor?

00:38:11.046 --> 00:38:13.440
Alys, I’m your mother.

00:38:13.465 --> 00:38:16.260
Of course, I’ll investigate
before I decide.

00:38:16.719 --> 00:38:20.343
I only trusted your Daddy and
Aunt Liana that you’d be safe,

00:38:20.368 --> 00:38:22.850
that’s why I allowed it.
And of course, I trust you.

00:38:23.267 --> 00:38:24.978
You already know
what’s right and wrong.

00:38:25.602 --> 00:38:28.230
Thank you, Mommy, and I
promise, I won’t break your trust.

00:38:31.608 --> 00:38:33.193
Mom, Dad, the car’s here.

00:38:33.902 --> 00:38:35.738
You sure you don’t
want us to take you?

00:38:35.946 --> 00:38:39.425
No, Dad, you already got
stressed in traffic earlier.

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:40.876
Just rest with Mom.

00:38:41.193 --> 00:38:45.014
Okay. Just make sure,
lock your doors.

00:38:45.039 --> 00:38:46.749
Yes, Mom, I’ll be fine.

00:38:47.041 --> 00:38:47.689
Okay.

00:38:47.714 --> 00:38:48.892
Okay.

00:38:48.917 --> 00:38:49.877
Rest now.

00:38:49.877 --> 00:38:51.600
- I love you.
- You still have class tomorrow.

00:38:51.625 --> 00:38:52.709
Alright.

00:38:53.047 --> 00:38:54.064
Okay, good night!

00:39:26.372 --> 00:39:27.097
Drake.

00:39:27.122 --> 00:39:28.868
You made me wait for 7 hours.

00:39:29.333 --> 00:39:30.657
Do you hate me that much?

00:39:31.418 --> 00:39:33.314
7 hours?

00:39:35.798 --> 00:39:38.175
Oh my gosh, I totally
forgot about our dinner.

00:39:44.476 --> 00:39:45.712
Should I follow him?

00:39:47.726 --> 00:39:48.811
No.

00:39:49.026 --> 00:39:53.614
You’re the one who forgot your
promise and you still dare to bug him.

00:39:54.145 --> 00:39:57.107
Besides, you’re
already broken up, right?

00:39:57.694 --> 00:40:02.032
You have no right to press the
1131 code on his door.

00:40:18.298 --> 00:40:19.298
Who else?

00:40:20.308 --> 00:40:21.308
It’s still me!

00:40:23.774 --> 00:40:28.934
At least my pillows give me
comfort and peace of mind.

00:40:30.894 --> 00:40:34.569
That Drake, even after the breakup,
he’s still messing with my head.

00:40:36.608 --> 00:40:37.860
Whose fault is this?

00:40:38.944 --> 00:40:40.866
Who’s the fool who
asked for a condo?

00:40:42.698 --> 00:40:43.740
Still me!

00:40:50.038 --> 00:40:51.038
Who’s that?

00:40:52.374 --> 00:40:53.374
What time is it?

00:40:55.377 --> 00:40:56.351
Wait!

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.200
Hold on!

00:41:04.803 --> 00:41:06.597
It’s late at night
and it’s causing nuisance.

00:41:06.726 --> 00:41:07.799
Just a moment!

00:41:13.596 --> 00:41:14.596
Drake…

00:41:16.648 --> 00:41:17.648
I changed my mind.

00:41:19.735 --> 00:41:20.461
Mmm?

00:41:20.486 --> 00:41:21.570
I can’t let you hate me.

00:41:23.322 --> 00:41:25.010
I’ll make you love me again.

00:41:26.533 --> 00:41:27.533
Come.

00:41:38.962 --> 00:41:39.730
Drake.

00:41:39.755 --> 00:41:40.807
What?

00:41:40.972 --> 00:41:42.369
Where are we going?

00:41:43.383 --> 00:41:45.924
Dinner. You have a dinner
date with me, remember?

00:41:47.554 --> 00:41:50.307
It’s almost 11. Is there
a restaurant still open?

00:41:51.808 --> 00:41:52.808
You’re right.

00:41:54.144 --> 00:41:55.144
Never mind.

00:42:08.383 --> 00:42:09.968
Wow, you bought so much.

00:42:09.993 --> 00:42:11.578
The convenient store
made money from you.

00:42:17.501 --> 00:42:18.501
Let’s go.

00:42:31.009 --> 00:42:32.674
Oh no, he’s on top of me!

00:42:33.141 --> 00:42:35.729
Mom’s gonna shave my
head if she finds out!

00:42:36.687 --> 00:42:37.687
Alys…

00:42:38.021 --> 00:42:39.021
Huh?

00:42:39.773 --> 00:42:40.773
Can I kiss you?

00:42:41.853 --> 00:42:42.853
Huh?

00:42:43.112 --> 00:42:45.657
I know we broke up,
but I feel like kissing you right now.

00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:50.659
Lord, is this a test to
see if I’ve moved on?

00:42:50.867 --> 00:42:54.432
Because if it is, my standing
might already be failing.

00:43:40.125 --> 00:43:43.432
It’s almost been a week since we last
talked or saw each other, Alys.

00:43:58.247 --> 00:44:00.749
I really really miss you, Alys.

00:44:10.864 --> 00:44:11.864
Not yet.

00:44:13.408 --> 00:44:14.768
I need to give her time.

00:44:27.098 --> 00:44:28.098
Alys?

00:44:53.812 --> 00:44:55.050
Anything for you, Alys.

00:44:55.075 --> 00:44:56.410
Thank you.

00:44:56.410 --> 00:44:57.869
And I hope you don’t mind.

00:44:57.869 --> 00:44:59.971
We already bought some of your things.

00:44:59.996 --> 00:45:02.182
I don’t mind at all.

00:45:02.207 --> 00:45:05.961
And also, if you want to
move in, you can start tonight.

00:45:06.294 --> 00:45:07.462
Alys.

00:45:15.305 --> 00:45:18.877
On the next episode of
Seducing Drake Palma.

00:45:19.474 --> 00:45:20.474
Answer me.

00:45:20.934 --> 00:45:21.934
Huh?

00:45:22.185 --> 00:45:23.770
Do you still feel the
same way about me,

00:45:25.211 --> 00:45:27.744
or have you forgotten how it
feels like to be in love with me?

00:45:28.608 --> 00:45:29.760
I’m going to court Alys.

00:45:31.421 --> 00:45:33.010
You’ve got no problem
with that, do you?

00:45:34.656 --> 00:45:35.656
You like her?

00:45:36.491 --> 00:45:38.807
Good luck.
She likes breaking hearts.

00:45:42.071 --> 00:45:43.114
- Drake.
- Drake!

00:45:44.374 --> 00:45:46.025
They don’t want to come with us.

00:45:46.585 --> 00:45:47.585
Let’s just go?

00:45:48.862 --> 00:45:49.862
Wait!

00:45:50.464 --> 00:45:51.857
Actually, we’ll come.

00:45:51.882 --> 00:45:55.093
Oh, by the way, how
was your debut, Alys?

00:45:55.635 --> 00:45:56.635
Huh?

00:45:57.345 --> 00:45:59.322
It was okay.

00:45:59.347 --> 00:46:02.479
Probably because Drake
didn’t arrive on time, right?

00:46:02.809 --> 00:46:06.119
Sorry, he had to
attend to my needs.

00:46:06.301 --> 00:46:08.783
We’re having a barbecue
party later, wanna come?

00:46:09.483 --> 00:46:10.483
Sure.

00:46:11.359 --> 00:46:12.819
OMG!

00:46:12.819 --> 00:46:14.361
You two are so perfect together!

00:46:16.114 --> 00:46:17.824
What’s your problem?!

00:46:20.994 --> 00:46:22.822
You told me that you
don’t like me anymore,

00:46:23.079 --> 00:46:24.432
so I’m trying to forget you.

00:46:24.585 --> 00:46:26.486
But why are you making
it so damn impossible?

00:46:27.334 --> 00:46:28.334
- No–
- Shut up!
