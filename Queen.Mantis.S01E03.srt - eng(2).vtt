00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.557
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.977
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAFETY GUIDELINES.

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:43.061
My goodness.

00:01:44.062 --> 00:01:45.563
What now?

00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:47.273
It looks like it was a hanging.

00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:49.734
We're waiting for Forensics
to determine the time of death.

00:01:49.818 --> 00:01:51.361
And we suspect sexual assault…

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:52.654
The closure of the mine

00:01:52.737 --> 00:01:54.447
left people destitute overnight.

00:01:55.907 --> 00:01:56.866
Back then, Woongsan

00:01:57.826 --> 00:01:59.577
was hell on earth.

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.958
The prospect of the city hosting a casino
had the people divided.

00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:08.253
The two sides clashed almost daily,
as if they were sworn enemies.

00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:10.505
As soon as dusk fell,

00:02:10.588 --> 00:02:13.133
the streets were crawling
with drunk ruffians.

00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:16.427
In a world void of law and order,

00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:18.471
women and children suffered abuse.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.142
We were inundated with reports of crime,

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:23.643
but we sang the same old refrain,

00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:26.271
and offered no real progress.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.566
"Please hang in there."

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:32.819
- "We will fix this soon."
- Let's go.

00:02:32.902 --> 00:02:33.862
That's when

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:36.364
she appeared.

00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:41.911
Please maintain order.

00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:46.249
A ruthless killer
who seemingly mocked the police

00:02:47.208 --> 00:02:48.793
by slaughtering the abusers

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:52.505
in the same vein as the torment
they inflicted on their victims.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.260
The Mantis.

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:19.741
Sung-gyu, you go that way.

00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:30.752
Captain!

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:35.256
Damn it.

00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:49.270
Mr. Kim. Kim Tae-seok!

00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:50.647
Sung-gyu!

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:58.154
Sung-gyu, call for a doctor.

00:03:58.238 --> 00:03:59.239
You can't die.

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:03.493
Kim Tae-seok!

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:07.872
I have to save him.

00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:08.915
You can't die.

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:10.833
You can't die.

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:14.837
You can't die.

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:16.089
- Cha Su-yeol.
- Please.

00:04:16.172 --> 00:04:18.091
You should become a cop.

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:24.013
Since five people have died…

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.059
you can save five people.

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:29.852
Please.

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:33.314
Please!

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:54.377
{\an8}THE ECOSYSTEM OF SHADE

00:05:23.614 --> 00:05:24.782
Don't even dream about it.

00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:31.706
Everyone in prison has the same dream.

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:41.257
The man who was missing
was a father of two kids.

00:05:42.216 --> 00:05:43.217
Luckily,

00:05:44.385 --> 00:05:45.803
he was able to return home safely.

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:49.474
Thank you

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:52.226
for your help.

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:54.353
I heard a gunshot.

00:06:16.084 --> 00:06:19.003
The foremost condition she set
for confessing everything

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.255
was that you be spared

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:23.382
any consequence of her downfall.

00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:26.803
She asked me to change your name

00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:29.639
and to personally

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:32.308
watch you grow up.

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:35.853
These are my conditions.

00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:38.272
A private space.

00:06:38.981 --> 00:06:39.982
Coffee.

00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:42.193
Music.

00:06:42.276 --> 00:06:43.277
Books.

00:06:44.028 --> 00:06:46.155
I compiled this list of essentials
after much thought.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:48.741
The most important thing

00:06:49.742 --> 00:06:51.285
is that no one can know

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:53.162
that Jeong-ho is my son.

00:06:54.872 --> 00:06:57.792
Please change his name,
including his surname.

00:06:59.335 --> 00:07:00.545
Were you worried?

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.468
Did you miss me?

00:07:13.891 --> 00:07:15.226
You agreed to help us

00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:19.689
on the condition that I'd be present
because you missed me, right?

00:07:22.358 --> 00:07:26.320
Is Seo Gu-wan,
that district office worker, still alive?

00:07:30.366 --> 00:07:31.909
He knows everything.

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:35.830
He knows that you're my son
and even knows that you're married.

00:07:35.913 --> 00:07:37.999
He probably knows where you live too.

00:07:39.208 --> 00:07:40.835
He knows your wife's name, after all.

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:43.713
Lee Jung-yeon.

00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:46.507
Does she know about me as well?

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:51.596
Don't tell me you told her.

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:06.986
I was told it was Yirgacheffe.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:10.323
Your favorite.

00:09:30.027 --> 00:09:33.155
I only put money in for one.
Wouldn't this be considered theft?

00:09:34.156 --> 00:09:35.324
I don't think so.

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:37.285
After all the money it ate from me?

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:49.922
I'm glad it worked out.

00:09:51.257 --> 00:09:52.883
You did all that on your own.

00:09:57.013 --> 00:09:58.723
Is that a compliment or a dig?

00:10:02.935 --> 00:10:05.855
When Seo Gu-wan was transported
to the hospital,

00:10:05.938 --> 00:10:08.441
I promise you were left out
only because things were so hectic.

00:10:09.233 --> 00:10:10.151
I hope

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:12.486
you don't misunderstand.

00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:14.572
I won't.

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.535
But, sir,

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:20.703
what do you think?

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:22.496
Do you believe

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.166
Seo Gu-wan is the culprit
behind these copycat crimes?

00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:26.709
I'm not sure.

00:10:27.543 --> 00:10:28.502
What about you?

00:10:34.091 --> 00:10:35.051
Take a look at this.

00:10:35.134 --> 00:10:36.636
His whole place was a mess,

00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:39.847
but this one spot was pristine
as if it were some hallowed shrine.

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:41.515
And this "zero" section.

00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:44.268
There's just a number with nothing else.

00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:45.978
That number can't be meaningless.

00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:50.107
This was where all the materials
on Jeong I-shin's victims were kept.

00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:54.654
That could mean…

00:10:54.737 --> 00:10:58.366
There might be another murder
committed by Jeong we are unaware of.

00:10:58.449 --> 00:11:00.368
A murder before the first.

00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:02.370
And you're saying Seo knows about it? How?

00:11:02.953 --> 00:11:04.205
Exactly.

00:11:04.288 --> 00:11:07.041
And the two murders
that precede his crime,

00:11:07.124 --> 00:11:08.834
he has no connections to either one.

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:12.004
Sir.

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:15.674
Last time, I made some mistakes
because I got too worked up.

00:11:15.758 --> 00:11:18.302
Please allow me to meet Seo again.

00:11:23.474 --> 00:11:26.477
Sure. It's not like I'm trying
to hide him away or anything.

00:11:27.019 --> 00:11:28.354
Let's go.

00:11:28.437 --> 00:11:29.772
Now?

00:11:29.855 --> 00:11:30.773
Yes.

00:11:30.856 --> 00:11:33.901
RESTRICTED AREA
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

00:11:42.451 --> 00:11:43.828
Did they say when he'd wake up?

00:11:44.495 --> 00:11:45.830
They're not sure.

00:11:47.331 --> 00:11:48.791
Considering his head injury and all.

00:11:53.504 --> 00:11:54.422
Mr. Seo Gu-wan.

00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:57.174
Mr. Seo, can you hear me?

00:11:57.842 --> 00:11:59.051
Mr. Seo Gu-wan.

00:12:19.822 --> 00:12:21.949
RAYEON CERAMIC STUDIO

00:12:28.122 --> 00:12:29.123
Jung-yeon.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:32.668
You haven't made your escape yet?

00:12:33.711 --> 00:12:35.296
Su-yeol, it's been forever.

00:12:35.379 --> 00:12:36.338
No, just keep that on.

00:12:36.422 --> 00:12:38.757
This is just a quick stop.
I need to get going soon.

00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:42.094
I thought you caught the culprit.

00:12:42.678 --> 00:12:43.596
Well…

00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:45.681
We need to keep
an eye on him for the time being.

00:12:45.764 --> 00:12:47.600
I can't really share the details with you.

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:51.020
Did you eat? Eat something before you go.

00:12:51.979 --> 00:12:53.439
I think I'm good on food.

00:12:56.066 --> 00:12:57.485
Can you just give me a hug?

00:12:59.653 --> 00:13:00.571
No.

00:13:01.405 --> 00:13:04.658
You're going to leave as soon as I do.

00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:06.285
Hurry up and hug me.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.209
We need to end it.

00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:15.294
We need to kill him now.

00:13:15.377 --> 00:13:16.754
He knows everything.

00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:21.133
Kids.

00:13:24.053 --> 00:13:26.514
This is a sacred place
of commerce and learning.

00:13:26.597 --> 00:13:28.098
What do you think you're doing?

00:13:28.182 --> 00:13:31.060
Go upstairs and do all that.
Your bedroom is right above us.

00:13:31.143 --> 00:13:32.895
No, Ah-ra, that's not it.

00:13:32.978 --> 00:13:34.647
I should get going.

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:35.564
I'm off.

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:37.358
- Hang in there.
- No need. You don't need to go.

00:13:37.441 --> 00:13:39.568
I'll give you two some privacy.
See it through.

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:40.945
Finish strong.

00:13:41.028 --> 00:13:43.989
No. He just stopped by for a quick visit.

00:13:44.073 --> 00:13:47.201
Su-yeol, be sure not to skip any meals.

00:13:47.284 --> 00:13:48.285
Okay.

00:13:48.369 --> 00:13:50.454
Ah-ra, I'll see you next time.
You keep it up too.

00:13:50.538 --> 00:13:51.539
- Okay.
- Bye.

00:13:52.248 --> 00:13:53.332
Bye.

00:13:54.416 --> 00:13:55.543
Drive safely.

00:14:06.303 --> 00:14:07.972
Being a police officer is no joke.

00:14:08.055 --> 00:14:09.848
The work never stops.

00:14:09.932 --> 00:14:13.519
But still, after this case closes,
he should be able to take some time off.

00:14:13.602 --> 00:14:14.895
Should we make some tea?

00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:17.606
NAMBU METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:20.860
HEINOUS MURDER
CUT TONGUE…

00:14:27.783 --> 00:14:28.993
And this "zero" section.

00:14:29.618 --> 00:14:32.329
There's just a number with nothing else.

00:14:32.913 --> 00:14:34.999
That number can't be meaningless.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:39.670
Hello, sir.

00:14:39.753 --> 00:14:42.381
What are you doing?
I told you to go home early today.

00:14:44.925 --> 00:14:45.801
What about it?

00:14:57.271 --> 00:14:58.856
What now?

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:02.359
The "first" murder we do not know about.

00:15:02.443 --> 00:15:05.321
Wait. How would
Seo Gu-wan know about that?

00:15:05.404 --> 00:15:06.530
I'm not sure.

00:15:07.406 --> 00:15:08.282
Something feels off.

00:15:08.365 --> 00:15:10.075
I think we've missed something.

00:15:11.952 --> 00:15:14.997
Are you saying there was
a murder I wasn't aware of?

00:15:18.667 --> 00:15:20.294
Damn…

00:15:26.258 --> 00:15:28.886
I held on to that
because the handwriting was different.

00:15:30.346 --> 00:15:33.349
HAVE COURAGE

00:15:39.229 --> 00:15:41.190

FROM J
ANWON, GYEONGGI PROVINCE

00:16:44.628 --> 00:16:47.423
This is the letter Jeong I-shin sent,
offering me help.

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:55.806
DEAR DETECTIVE CHOI

00:16:55.889 --> 00:16:56.849
They're written…

00:16:59.059 --> 00:17:00.227
in similar handwriting.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.730
Worlds apart
from Seo Gu-wan's handwriting.

00:17:03.313 --> 00:17:04.314
But,

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:08.235
this is too short
for a forensic handwriting analysis.

00:17:08.318 --> 00:17:09.194
Right.

00:17:09.278 --> 00:17:12.865
But they are very similar, aren't they?

00:17:13.532 --> 00:17:15.617
That's why I wanted to check.

00:17:16.493 --> 00:17:17.494
Sir.

00:17:17.578 --> 00:17:18.829
If…

00:17:19.705 --> 00:17:22.291
Jeong I-shin had indeed
written this letter…

00:17:22.916 --> 00:17:25.252
If she finally replied to him
with words of encouragement,

00:17:25.878 --> 00:17:28.964
after never replying
to any of his letters before…

00:17:32.468 --> 00:17:33.635
That would have served

00:17:34.511 --> 00:17:36.889
as great motivation for Seo Gu-wan.

00:17:41.643 --> 00:17:42.603
Why would she?

00:17:43.187 --> 00:17:45.355
What did she stand to gain…

00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:49.193
from Seo Gu-wan killing somebody?

00:18:22.976 --> 00:18:24.603
I'm envious.

00:18:24.686 --> 00:18:27.439
You get to just show up unannounced,
whenever you wish.

00:18:28.023 --> 00:18:30.984
While I'm required to welcome you,
regardless of my discomfort.

00:18:51.255 --> 00:18:52.464
They're warm.

00:18:55.592 --> 00:18:57.177
Even after they killed five…

00:19:00.013 --> 00:19:01.056
Or is it six?

00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:03.559
What's wrong with you?

00:19:05.644 --> 00:19:06.728
My thoughts exactly.

00:19:08.397 --> 00:19:10.065
What is wrong with you?

00:19:18.115 --> 00:19:19.950
Why did you manipulate Seo Gu-wan?

00:19:20.909 --> 00:19:22.077
Were you bored?

00:19:22.786 --> 00:19:24.246
Was prison life too monotonous?

00:19:27.666 --> 00:19:28.917
There's another beyond…

00:19:30.794 --> 00:19:32.296
the original five, isn't there?

00:19:32.921 --> 00:19:34.256
I already told him everything.

00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:36.967
Did Seo Gu-wan know about it?

00:19:39.052 --> 00:19:40.053
Jeong I-shin.

00:19:40.637 --> 00:19:41.555
Answer me.

00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:44.850
Before you cut Cho Geon-ung's tongue out

00:19:44.933 --> 00:19:46.768
and abandoned his corpse by the stream,

00:19:47.895 --> 00:19:50.063
you killed someone else, didn't you?

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:55.194
You should ask
Detective Choi Jung-ho such questions.

00:19:56.195 --> 00:20:00.115
I already finished confessing
a long time ago.

00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:01.116
Jeong I-shin!

00:20:21.929 --> 00:20:22.930
Chief Choi thought

00:20:24.765 --> 00:20:27.184
you might've requested this arrangement
so you could see me.

00:20:27.726 --> 00:20:30.312
He thought that you must have missed me

00:20:30.395 --> 00:20:32.147
after not seeing me for 23 years.

00:20:35.442 --> 00:20:37.527
Sentimental old-timer.

00:20:43.116 --> 00:20:45.244
Your life was
on a strict schedule in prison,

00:20:46.954 --> 00:20:48.538
but that's not the case out here.

00:20:49.373 --> 00:20:52.125
You are here to cooperate
in a copycat murder case.

00:20:52.209 --> 00:20:55.462
I have the right and obligation
to interview and interrogate you,

00:20:55.545 --> 00:20:58.507
on any day and at any time of day
I deem necessary.

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:00.008
If it causes you such discomfort…

00:21:02.761 --> 00:21:03.679
please speak up.

00:21:05.138 --> 00:21:06.640
I will have you returned.

00:21:07.891 --> 00:21:09.643
At the end of the day, Seo Gu-wan is

00:21:09.726 --> 00:21:11.728
the only one insane enough
to want to see you.

00:21:19.653 --> 00:21:20.821
I'm done for today.

00:21:44.886 --> 00:21:46.138
Someone else died.

00:21:49.308 --> 00:21:52.394
What is going on?
Is this related to the other murders?

00:22:11.163 --> 00:22:12.039
He's here.

00:22:12.622 --> 00:22:13.707
Hello.

00:22:14.416 --> 00:22:15.876
Watch where you step in the pond,

00:22:15.959 --> 00:22:17.794
and make sure
not to displace any evidence.

00:22:17.878 --> 00:22:19.588
Heung-su, you measure

00:22:19.671 --> 00:22:21.882
and photograph
each mirror from the body's position.

00:22:31.266 --> 00:22:33.351
The victim is Yoo Si-hyeon, 42.

00:22:33.435 --> 00:22:36.063
A professor at Hyoryeong College of Music.
No criminal record.

00:22:36.146 --> 00:22:38.190
All of his family lives in Vancouver.

00:22:38.273 --> 00:22:39.858
He lived alone in this house.

00:22:39.941 --> 00:22:40.859
And…

00:22:41.443 --> 00:22:43.361
an injection mark
was discovered on his neck.

00:22:43.445 --> 00:22:46.281
So many damn mirrors.
It's like 4DX in here.

00:22:46.364 --> 00:22:48.408
It must be a message for us.

00:22:48.492 --> 00:22:50.368
"I'm out here alive and well."

00:22:50.452 --> 00:22:53.538
"Stop going after the wrong guy
and making a fool of yourself."

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.333
Kim Hyeon-u.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.337
Kang Su-cheol.

00:23:01.338 --> 00:23:02.714
And Yoo Si-hyeon.

00:23:04.216 --> 00:23:05.634
A severed tongue,

00:23:06.426 --> 00:23:07.886
a decapitation,

00:23:07.969 --> 00:23:10.138
and now, a death by drowning.

00:23:10.889 --> 00:23:12.265
We weren't able to save anyone.

00:23:13.391 --> 00:23:15.644
We couldn't stop any of it.

00:23:15.727 --> 00:23:16.978
At this time,

00:23:17.062 --> 00:23:19.648
the victim has been identified
as a college professor.

00:23:19.731 --> 00:23:22.275
The police have been denying

00:23:22.359 --> 00:23:25.612
the possible connection
to the Nodu Stream and Warehouse Murders,

00:23:25.695 --> 00:23:28.031
but the suspicions
are impossible to dismiss.

00:23:28.115 --> 00:23:29.699
This has been OTC Reporter…

00:23:29.783 --> 00:23:31.785
Sir, can you give us a statement?

00:23:58.145 --> 00:23:59.688
You're the squad leader, right?

00:23:59.771 --> 00:24:01.565
Is this murder case connected

00:24:01.648 --> 00:24:02.899
to the Nodu Stream Murder?

00:24:02.983 --> 00:24:04.276
Sir.

00:24:04.359 --> 00:24:05.527
Sir.

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:06.444
Sir.

00:24:07.571 --> 00:24:09.614
Is this murder case connected

00:24:09.698 --> 00:24:11.032
to the Nodu Stream Murder?

00:24:11.116 --> 00:24:12.200
Sir.

00:24:12.284 --> 00:24:13.118
Sir.

00:24:17.539 --> 00:24:18.832
SU-YEOL

00:24:23.753 --> 00:24:24.921
Su-yeol.

00:24:25.005 --> 00:24:26.423
I just saw you on the news.

00:24:27.841 --> 00:24:30.594
Tell me you didn't see your mom again.

00:24:31.511 --> 00:24:33.138
Answer me.

00:24:33.221 --> 00:24:36.641
Mr. Jeong, this is Jung-yeon.

00:24:36.725 --> 00:24:38.768
Su-yeol's taking a shower right now.

00:24:39.352 --> 00:24:41.980
Gosh. Hey, Jung-yeon.

00:24:42.522 --> 00:24:43.773
I see.

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:47.861
I was watching the news and got worried.

00:24:48.862 --> 00:24:50.197
It's nothing serious.

00:24:51.364 --> 00:24:52.365
Sorry.

00:24:52.449 --> 00:24:55.160
I'll call him back later.

00:24:55.243 --> 00:24:56.286
Okay.

00:25:04.294 --> 00:25:06.171
That smells delicious.

00:25:07.547 --> 00:25:10.091
I told you to dry yourself completely
before coming out.

00:25:10.175 --> 00:25:11.885
It's fine, I'll be dry in no time.

00:25:11.968 --> 00:25:13.720
You also have that wound on your hand.

00:25:13.803 --> 00:25:16.306
Dry it well before applying ointment
or it might get infected.

00:25:16.932 --> 00:25:18.225
Let's do it after dinner.

00:25:18.308 --> 00:25:20.060
It's been ages since I had dinner at home.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:21.728
Afterward,

00:25:21.811 --> 00:25:24.272
please apply some ointment

00:25:25.065 --> 00:25:26.900
on my wound, Dear Wife.

00:25:26.983 --> 00:25:30.445
Dear Husband, why do you always come home
with a new wound?

00:25:30.528 --> 00:25:31.947
It makes your dear wife worry.

00:25:32.822 --> 00:25:35.283
Technically, I don't get hurt every day.

00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:38.370
I'm known for my superb physique
and catlike agility on my team.

00:25:38.453 --> 00:25:39.913
Can't you tell?

00:25:41.164 --> 00:25:43.208
And this is nothing serious.

00:25:43.291 --> 00:25:44.501
Just a scratch.

00:25:45.585 --> 00:25:46.795
Fine.

00:25:48.755 --> 00:25:50.632
I told you I'm really fine…

00:25:52.509 --> 00:25:53.510
Here we go.

00:26:03.019 --> 00:26:04.980
I swear I'm fine.

00:26:05.063 --> 00:26:06.398
Okay.

00:26:06.982 --> 00:26:08.692
I added peas to the rice.

00:26:09.567 --> 00:26:11.403
I love them. I love them so much.

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:26.668
Done.

00:26:26.751 --> 00:26:29.129
I'll apply some more
after you shower tomorrow morning.

00:26:29.713 --> 00:26:30.880
Jung-yeon.

00:26:31.589 --> 00:26:32.841
I saw the news.

00:26:34.342 --> 00:26:35.343
You did?

00:26:36.553 --> 00:26:39.139
Forensics wasn't even done
with their investigation,

00:26:39.222 --> 00:26:41.308
but the reporters swarmed in.
I had no choice but to--

00:26:41.391 --> 00:26:42.350
You always tell me

00:26:42.434 --> 00:26:45.103
that it's okay. That it's no big deal.

00:26:45.186 --> 00:26:49.065
But I'm totally not okay
with finding out you're having a hard time

00:26:49.149 --> 00:26:52.110
or that you're angry about something
through the news.

00:26:54.654 --> 00:26:56.781
If you're having a hard time, just say so.

00:26:56.865 --> 00:27:00.618
Just tell me when you're upset
about being stuck in a case.

00:27:02.329 --> 00:27:03.997
Loop me in.

00:27:05.915 --> 00:27:07.167
Jung-yeon.

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:08.460
It feels like you're secretly

00:27:09.336 --> 00:27:11.046
going out of your way to hide it from me.

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:13.631
I'm really sorry.

00:27:14.424 --> 00:27:15.550
I just…

00:27:16.593 --> 00:27:17.802
didn't want you to worry.

00:27:19.304 --> 00:27:20.347
Am I hard to talk to?

00:27:21.514 --> 00:27:23.683
Do you find me so untrustworthy,

00:27:23.767 --> 00:27:26.770
you feel the need to go out of your way
to hide your feelings and always have

00:27:26.853 --> 00:27:28.480
a smile on your face in my presence?

00:27:28.563 --> 00:27:29.731
Not at all.

00:27:30.398 --> 00:27:32.233
I swear it's nothing like that.

00:27:32.817 --> 00:27:34.736
I'm sorry. I won't ever do that again.

00:27:34.819 --> 00:27:36.780
Why would I not trust you?

00:27:36.863 --> 00:27:39.324
You're the one person
I trust in this world.

00:27:41.368 --> 00:27:43.661
Jung-yeon. Come on.

00:27:43.745 --> 00:27:46.039
Look at me. Come on.

00:27:46.915 --> 00:27:49.376
No, just look at me.

00:27:49.459 --> 00:27:50.710
Look at me.

00:27:51.544 --> 00:27:52.587
Look at me.

00:27:55.882 --> 00:27:57.258
Okay. Come here.

00:28:03.723 --> 00:28:06.684
I told you to dry your hair properly.
You're going to stink at this rate.

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:08.853
What are you going to do

00:28:08.937 --> 00:28:11.189
when they start teasing you
as Captain Stink?

00:28:12.273 --> 00:28:13.191
I'd like that.

00:28:14.818 --> 00:28:16.820
I'm okay with Captain Stink.

00:30:04.636 --> 00:30:06.888
MANTIS COPYCAT CRIME
NODU STREAM

00:30:09.265 --> 00:30:11.601
SIHONG-DONG POND

00:30:11.684 --> 00:30:13.353
VICTIM YOO SI-HYEON

00:30:21.736 --> 00:30:22.862
What's that flashing light?

00:30:26.241 --> 00:30:27.242
A self-defense flashlight.

00:30:27.325 --> 00:30:29.828
Given the numerous types
and varied distribution routes,

00:30:29.911 --> 00:30:30.912
it's untraceable.

00:30:32.997 --> 00:30:35.250
If he was trying to overpower someone,

00:30:35.333 --> 00:30:38.253
a taser gun or stun gun
would've been more foolproof.

00:30:38.336 --> 00:30:40.630
He was confident
he could overpower the victim.

00:30:41.631 --> 00:30:43.132
He distracted him with the light,

00:30:44.175 --> 00:30:45.426
before knocking him out.

00:30:46.803 --> 00:30:47.846
Any unusual findings?

00:30:47.929 --> 00:30:50.056
The victim's phone is missing.

00:30:50.139 --> 00:30:52.350
That's a recurring pattern
across all the cases.

00:30:53.393 --> 00:30:54.894
He must have his reasons.

00:30:54.978 --> 00:30:57.814
Maybe something on them
could be used to identify him.

00:31:01.109 --> 00:31:02.193
It's Yoo Si-hyeon.

00:31:02.277 --> 00:31:03.403
His phone is on.

00:31:25.967 --> 00:31:28.094
First snow isn't always just romantic.

00:31:28.177 --> 00:31:29.846
Looks like the signal's coming from there.

00:31:29.929 --> 00:31:31.598
This is just too easy.

00:31:31.681 --> 00:31:33.266
I'm not alone in thinking that, right?

00:31:33.349 --> 00:31:34.809
He could've slipped up.

00:31:34.893 --> 00:31:36.603
Let's start investigating.

00:31:37.186 --> 00:31:39.188
Hyuk, you and I will go
to the left of this house.

00:31:39.272 --> 00:31:40.481
You two can go to the right.

00:31:40.565 --> 00:31:41.524
Let's go.

00:31:42.275 --> 00:31:43.526
Hey, Hyuk.

00:31:44.402 --> 00:31:46.779
He's never left
even a strand of hair at the scene.

00:31:46.863 --> 00:31:47.822
How is this not weird?

00:31:48.823 --> 00:31:50.491
I dreamed of my late grandma last night.

00:31:50.575 --> 00:31:51.534
So?

00:31:51.618 --> 00:31:53.953
Last time she appeared,
I got stabbed, remember?

00:31:54.037 --> 00:31:55.079
Right.

00:31:55.163 --> 00:31:57.415
I have a bad feeling about this.

00:31:57.498 --> 00:31:58.541
We need to do something.

00:31:58.625 --> 00:32:00.668
Give me a receipt,
one for over 100,000 won.

00:32:00.752 --> 00:32:02.170
Hold on.

00:32:04.088 --> 00:32:05.131
Here.

00:32:14.515 --> 00:32:15.767
Begone. Away with you.

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:17.602
Hey! Hurry up!

00:32:22.106 --> 00:32:23.524
Su-yeol.

00:32:23.608 --> 00:32:25.276
Tell me you didn't see your mom again.

00:32:28.404 --> 00:32:30.406
YEONPO BRIDGE CAR ACCIDENT

00:32:32.909 --> 00:32:36.120
SAFETY INITIATIVES IMPLEMENTED
AFTER YEONPO BRIDGE CAR ACCIDENT

00:32:39.374 --> 00:32:40.375
Boo!

00:32:41.626 --> 00:32:42.961
You scared the crap out of me!

00:32:43.044 --> 00:32:44.420
Sorry.

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.674
But why are you so…

00:33:36.931 --> 00:33:37.932
Anyone home?

00:33:40.018 --> 00:33:41.060
Hello?

00:34:13.051 --> 00:34:14.552
My son.

00:34:14.635 --> 00:34:16.304
There we go.

00:34:16.387 --> 00:34:18.056
Guess what this is.

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:20.767
Jeong-ho, you know how you like to draw?

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:22.018
So I made this for you.

00:34:23.144 --> 00:34:24.145
Ta-da.

00:34:24.228 --> 00:34:26.147
There you go, Jeong-ho.

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:29.150
Draw me an amazing portrait.

00:34:29.233 --> 00:34:31.569
- Okay.
- Excellent.

00:34:31.652 --> 00:34:33.112
How should I pose?

00:34:33.863 --> 00:34:36.407
I'm just going to draw what I see.

00:34:53.758 --> 00:34:56.052
Jeong-ho, why are you so good at throwing?

00:34:56.135 --> 00:34:57.053
With a mighty spin…

00:35:00.681 --> 00:35:01.933
You're so strong.

00:35:02.016 --> 00:35:05.645
Okay, I'm going to throw this
really high in the air. Try catching it.

00:35:05.728 --> 00:35:07.563
Heave-ho!

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:11.818
Oh, no. It fell into the well.

00:35:14.028 --> 00:35:14.862
Captain.

00:35:19.033 --> 00:35:21.744
Hey, Detective Kim. Did you find anything?

00:35:23.204 --> 00:35:25.456
He said she passed away in this accident.

00:35:26.207 --> 00:35:28.793
But not one article mentions
a woman dying.

00:35:28.876 --> 00:35:31.212
Then, are you saying
his mother is still alive?

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:35.550
Yes. Mr. Jeong's call confirmed it.

00:35:36.509 --> 00:35:39.512
But newspapers can be wrong.

00:35:39.595 --> 00:35:41.973
You should just ask him directly
if you have questions.

00:35:42.056 --> 00:35:45.017
But he has never once
brought up his family first.

00:35:45.101 --> 00:35:47.478
Even when I ask,
he just glosses over it with a joke.

00:35:49.647 --> 00:35:52.066
Then, maybe you should just let it go.

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:53.901
You guys are so good already.

00:35:54.610 --> 00:35:56.821
It'd be a different story
if he brought it up.

00:35:58.573 --> 00:35:59.657
Lee Jung-yeon.

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:02.326
What's with that solemn face?

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:03.786
Look at that sulk. Stand up.

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:05.621
Get up. Just forget it.

00:36:05.705 --> 00:36:07.123
It's over. Move on.

00:36:07.957 --> 00:36:09.542
Just help me with my brushwork.

00:36:10.459 --> 00:36:13.045
I heard his mother was buried

00:36:13.546 --> 00:36:15.673
in the town
where Su-yeol lived as a child.

00:36:19.427 --> 00:36:20.469
Should we go there?

00:36:21.304 --> 00:36:23.973
Let's just go before you stew over it.

00:36:24.974 --> 00:36:26.017
That would be better, right?

00:36:32.607 --> 00:36:34.775
- That piece of…
- What is it?

00:36:34.859 --> 00:36:36.986
He's definitely watching us
from somewhere.

00:36:37.069 --> 00:36:38.946
Really? How do you know?

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:40.907
He's mocking us.

00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:43.743
He's probably getting off
on watching us bust our asses.

00:36:43.826 --> 00:36:45.328
That's his goal here.

00:36:46.746 --> 00:36:48.748
Hey! You enjoying yourself?

00:36:48.831 --> 00:36:50.249
Having fun?

00:36:50.333 --> 00:36:51.626
You rotten bastard!

00:36:51.709 --> 00:36:52.793
What's going on?

00:36:54.754 --> 00:36:55.922
It's nothing.

00:36:56.964 --> 00:36:59.217
What time is it?
Aren't you getting hungry?

00:37:03.846 --> 00:37:04.847
Let's call it a day here.

00:37:05.389 --> 00:37:06.474
Let's take another spin.

00:37:08.267 --> 00:37:09.685
It's getting late.

00:37:09.769 --> 00:37:11.229
You're still unsatisfied, sir.

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:14.065
I guess you could say that.

00:37:14.148 --> 00:37:16.317
We should take another spin
if you feel something's off.

00:37:17.151 --> 00:37:19.946
You remember how he found
Kim Tae-seok last time?

00:37:21.072 --> 00:37:21.906
One more spin.

00:37:21.989 --> 00:37:23.783
If we don't find anything,
then we move on.

00:37:24.367 --> 00:37:25.826
Sir.

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:27.453
This is probably nothing,

00:37:28.037 --> 00:37:29.914
but inside that kitchen
of the house next door…

00:37:37.421 --> 00:37:38.256
What about it?

00:37:38.339 --> 00:37:40.007
We're not in the yard.

00:37:40.091 --> 00:37:42.843
Isn't it weird that this earthenware jar
is just sitting in this room?

00:37:42.927 --> 00:37:45.012
With a random red ball inside, no less.

00:37:46.347 --> 00:37:48.808
I told you it's probably nothing.

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:03.739
By chance,

00:38:04.907 --> 00:38:07.159
has anyone seen
anything like a well around?

00:38:07.243 --> 00:38:08.411
A well?

00:38:10.454 --> 00:38:12.415
This house looks like

00:38:12.498 --> 00:38:14.583
it was built a long time ago.

00:38:15.293 --> 00:38:17.211
This town must predate
the water supply system,

00:38:17.295 --> 00:38:19.714
and they're bound to have wells.

00:38:19.797 --> 00:38:21.090
But I haven't seen any around.

00:38:21.173 --> 00:38:24.593
They probably got rid of it
when the water supply came in.

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:27.263
They would've sealed it, just in case.

00:38:27.346 --> 00:38:28.973
They wouldn't just get rid of it.

00:38:29.557 --> 00:38:30.474
Have you seen one?

00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:32.768
Maybe that was it?

00:38:33.352 --> 00:38:35.771
I did see something as we pulled in.

00:38:40.776 --> 00:38:41.986
It's over there.

00:38:46.907 --> 00:38:48.075
Help me lift it up.

00:38:49.285 --> 00:38:50.119
One, two, three.

00:39:05.676 --> 00:39:08.304
WELCOME! YOU FINALLY FOUND IT

00:39:18.272 --> 00:39:20.775
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

00:39:24.278 --> 00:39:26.864
It seems a different weapon was used here
than in the stab wound

00:39:26.947 --> 00:39:28.157
in his back.

00:39:30.201 --> 00:39:31.452
Maybe a razor blade?

00:39:36.415 --> 00:39:38.292
- Has everyone gathered?
- Yes.

00:39:38.376 --> 00:39:40.211
His name is Jeong Won-sik.

00:39:40.294 --> 00:39:42.129
He went missing suddenly three months ago.

00:39:42.213 --> 00:39:45.257
He was a developer
at Digi Solution, an IT company.

00:39:45.341 --> 00:39:47.510
Back in the early 2000s, when the agency

00:39:47.593 --> 00:39:49.261
was digitizing criminal records,

00:39:49.345 --> 00:39:51.472
his company was one of the participants.

00:39:51.555 --> 00:39:55.101
Then, I assume his company had access
to Jeong I-shin's records as well?

00:39:55.184 --> 00:39:57.978
Yes, it seems the culprit
used this man, Jeong Won-sik,

00:39:58.813 --> 00:40:01.357
to get data on Jeong I-shin
that the police were only privy to.

00:40:03.734 --> 00:40:05.486
- Hello.
- Hey. You're fine.

00:40:06.487 --> 00:40:08.072
So, Jeong I-shin's copycat killer?

00:40:08.155 --> 00:40:09.990
Ma'am, it has been a while.

00:40:10.074 --> 00:40:12.034
It has been a while.

00:40:12.118 --> 00:40:13.786
Hey, honey.

00:40:13.869 --> 00:40:16.330
It's been a while
since I've seen you, too, Su-yeol.

00:40:16.414 --> 00:40:17.915
You're all working so hard here.

00:40:17.998 --> 00:40:19.834
Maybe come home once in a while.

00:40:21.419 --> 00:40:24.922
Ma'am, maybe you can save
your marital spat for later?

00:40:25.005 --> 00:40:26.465
What did you find?

00:40:26.549 --> 00:40:30.052
The official cause of death is
repeated stab wounds.

00:40:30.136 --> 00:40:32.430
Based on the state of the corpse,

00:40:32.513 --> 00:40:35.057
the time of death was
no less than three months ago.

00:40:35.141 --> 00:40:36.434
Three months…

00:40:36.517 --> 00:40:37.601
If it was three months ago,

00:40:38.185 --> 00:40:40.187
it happened before the Nodu Stream Murder.

00:40:40.271 --> 00:40:43.482
But here's the really strange part.

00:40:44.233 --> 00:40:45.860
From the restraint marks, it looks like

00:40:45.943 --> 00:40:47.486
the victim had already been subdued.

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:49.572
But strangely enough,

00:40:49.655 --> 00:40:53.075
the stab wound on his back seems like
it was inflicted impulsively.

00:40:53.159 --> 00:40:56.120
I don't believe it was a dagger…

00:40:56.203 --> 00:40:58.205
More like fabric shears.

00:40:59.331 --> 00:41:02.293
But the wounds on his chest and neck

00:41:02.376 --> 00:41:04.712
look like they were
almost mischievously drawn on,

00:41:04.795 --> 00:41:08.132
as if the assailant was toying around
with him as he bled to death.

00:41:10.468 --> 00:41:11.427
It's odd, isn't it?

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:13.012
Jeong I-shin's copycat killer?

00:41:13.971 --> 00:41:16.682
There's no overlap at all
to suggest this is a copycat killer.

00:41:17.808 --> 00:41:19.977
Kim Hyeon-u with his severed tongue,

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:22.104
Kang Su-cheol in the warehouse,

00:41:22.188 --> 00:41:24.106
and Yoo Si-hyeon, who drowned to death.

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:27.067
They're all undeniably copycat crimes
imitating Jeong I-shin.

00:41:27.735 --> 00:41:29.445
However, Jeong Won-sik is not.

00:41:30.029 --> 00:41:31.489
He's totally different.

00:41:31.572 --> 00:41:32.656
But what if

00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:35.075
this was his first murder?

00:41:36.785 --> 00:41:38.412
Could he have impulsively stabbed

00:41:38.496 --> 00:41:41.707
the victim from behind first,
before embracing Jeong's methods

00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:43.459
and emulating her style?

00:41:43.542 --> 00:41:45.836
That would mean
he got a taste for blood with this,

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:48.422
and followed in
Jeong I-shin's footsteps afterward.

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:52.384
But none of Jeong I-shin's murders

00:41:52.468 --> 00:41:55.054
ever involved a body in a well.

00:41:57.056 --> 00:41:57.973
Sir.

00:41:58.682 --> 00:42:00.351
We found this in Seo Gu-wan's place.

00:42:00.434 --> 00:42:03.020
You'll see that
the "zero" section is empty.

00:42:05.523 --> 00:42:08.609
Seo Gu-wan gathered
all these materials on Jeong I-shin

00:42:08.692 --> 00:42:10.986
to put on display in this sort of shrine.

00:42:17.826 --> 00:42:21.247
A SECOND MURDER…
ANOTHER MAN MURDERED IN WOONGSAN

00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:23.165
FOURTH IN SERIAL KILLING
FIFTH KILLING…

00:42:49.984 --> 00:42:52.528
YEONPO BRIDGE

00:45:47.327 --> 00:45:49.788
Do you just love choosing
this exact hour to drop by?

00:45:53.375 --> 00:45:54.751
Can we have some privacy?

00:46:17.858 --> 00:46:19.109
Was it Dad?

00:46:22.779 --> 00:46:23.906
Was it?

00:46:38.253 --> 00:46:39.421
Yeah.

00:46:48.305 --> 00:46:49.598
I did it.

00:46:51.433 --> 00:46:54.269
It was the best thing
I have ever done in my life.

00:46:55.521 --> 00:46:56.939
I still believe that.

00:46:58.106 --> 00:46:59.900
How could you do that to your own husband?

00:47:01.735 --> 00:47:03.946
He was my dad!

00:47:05.656 --> 00:47:08.075
But you managed
to make it out alive as a result.

00:47:09.159 --> 00:47:11.370
That was what was most important to me.

00:47:11.453 --> 00:47:12.788
It's fine.

00:47:12.871 --> 00:47:14.790
Stop speaking nonsense.

00:47:16.833 --> 00:47:19.169
You killed my dad so I could live?

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:21.630
It was for my sake?

00:47:22.339 --> 00:47:24.383
How could you be so shameless?

00:47:24.967 --> 00:47:28.512
How could you make
such a despicable excuse now?

00:47:29.346 --> 00:47:31.557
It's not an excuse.

00:47:35.102 --> 00:47:36.478
You probably don't remember it,

00:47:36.562 --> 00:47:38.647
but that man was always drunk.

00:47:39.273 --> 00:47:40.607
He was drunk that day too.

00:47:44.403 --> 00:47:45.320
You're back.

00:47:45.404 --> 00:47:47.197
Yeah. Where's Jeong-ho?

00:47:47.281 --> 00:47:49.366
He's sleeping. It's late.

00:47:49.449 --> 00:47:53.036
That damn punk should be out here
to welcome his father home.

00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:55.122
Just let him be. He fell asleep late.

00:47:55.205 --> 00:47:56.248
Fine.

00:48:09.761 --> 00:48:10.762
What's wrong?

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:13.056
Does the house smell or something?

00:48:14.433 --> 00:48:15.475
Come up here.

00:48:17.477 --> 00:48:18.729
Stop it.

00:48:19.396 --> 00:48:20.439
Sit here now!

00:48:22.232 --> 00:48:23.191
Okay.

00:48:23.275 --> 00:48:25.902
I heard you. There's no need to scream.
You're going to wake him up.

00:48:26.945 --> 00:48:29.489
No. Forget it. Get up.

00:48:30.073 --> 00:48:30.949
Stand up.

00:49:05.859 --> 00:49:06.818
You know, right?

00:49:07.402 --> 00:49:09.529
You know how much
I cherish you, don't you?

00:49:14.451 --> 00:49:15.577
I know.

00:49:16.161 --> 00:49:17.245
Thank you.

00:49:17.788 --> 00:49:21.333
But it's really late.
You should go to bed.

00:49:21.416 --> 00:49:23.877
I'll clean up here
and be there in no time.

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:25.796
This is so nice.

00:49:30.384 --> 00:49:31.343
Gosh.

00:49:40.394 --> 00:49:41.687
Was it one of those damn miners?

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:46.108
How could you say such a thing?

00:49:46.191 --> 00:49:49.194
I think it rubbed off on me
when I was cleaning the kitchen earlier.

00:49:49.277 --> 00:49:52.364
Those bastards covered in soot
cross that bridge with sinister thoughts.

00:49:52.447 --> 00:49:55.909
Their eyes grow wide, and they go into
a frenzy at the sight of town women.

00:49:57.202 --> 00:49:58.328
Did you think I didn't know?

00:49:59.413 --> 00:50:00.414
Strip.

00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:02.624
Here?

00:50:04.334 --> 00:50:06.503
Nobody comes to our house.

00:50:06.586 --> 00:50:07.796
You're mistaken.

00:50:07.879 --> 00:50:09.464
Strip if you have nothing to hide.

00:50:10.298 --> 00:50:12.217
If I just find
one soot smudge on your body…

00:50:14.094 --> 00:50:15.637
Hurry up!

00:50:15.721 --> 00:50:17.431
Before I rip it all off!

00:50:19.015 --> 00:50:20.851
Okay. Let's go to our room.

00:50:20.934 --> 00:50:22.227
No. Here.

00:50:22.811 --> 00:50:24.896
Let's go to our room.
I can strip for you there.

00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:26.773
Why are you so desperate to go inside?

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:32.904
Goddamnit.

00:50:35.282 --> 00:50:37.909
What the hell did you do out here exactly?

00:50:38.452 --> 00:50:39.703
What are you hiding?

00:50:40.704 --> 00:50:42.247
You nasty…

00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:45.333
There's nothing here.
I'm not hiding anything.

00:50:45.417 --> 00:50:46.293
Stop it.

00:50:46.793 --> 00:50:47.919
Stop it!

00:50:48.628 --> 00:50:51.798
Jeong-ho, go back inside.
Dad and I are having a conversation.

00:50:51.882 --> 00:50:53.300
Stop bothering Mom!

00:50:53.383 --> 00:50:54.384
That punk.

00:50:55.177 --> 00:50:57.220
Are you sure he's even mine? Are you?

00:50:57.304 --> 00:50:58.764
What are you… Honey!

00:50:58.847 --> 00:51:00.515
- Come here, you punk.
- Honey, please stop!

00:51:00.599 --> 00:51:01.975
- Move it.
- Honey.

00:51:02.058 --> 00:51:03.518
I'll teach you a damn lesson.

00:51:03.602 --> 00:51:04.978
Honey, please don't.

00:51:05.061 --> 00:51:06.146
No!

00:51:06.229 --> 00:51:07.105
Why you…

00:51:07.189 --> 00:51:08.273
Stop it!

00:51:08.356 --> 00:51:10.358
Come out. Come on, you damn punk!

00:51:10.442 --> 00:51:12.235
- How dare you…
- I'm sorry, Dad!

00:51:12.319 --> 00:51:14.863
- Damn punk. Are you Kim Jeong-ho?
- Mom! Dad!

00:51:14.946 --> 00:51:17.115
Are you sure you're a Kim?
Are you sure you're my son?

00:51:17.199 --> 00:51:19.785
Damn punk. You just wag that damn tongue.

00:51:19.868 --> 00:51:20.869
Get down there!

00:51:21.411 --> 00:51:23.288
You little shit!

00:51:23.371 --> 00:51:25.707
You dare talk back to your father?
Damn punk.

00:51:25.791 --> 00:51:27.292
Take that!

00:51:27.375 --> 00:51:28.585
You little shit!

00:51:28.668 --> 00:51:29.795
Stop it!

00:51:36.343 --> 00:51:37.511
Jeong-ho.

00:51:42.265 --> 00:51:44.100
Thankfully, you weren't hurt badly.

00:51:44.643 --> 00:51:46.853
You fainted from the shock.

00:51:49.648 --> 00:51:50.857
You're lying.

00:51:51.775 --> 00:51:52.901
It's hazy,

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:56.613
but I remember everything. My dad…

00:52:00.492 --> 00:52:02.536
He made me a desk.

00:52:02.619 --> 00:52:04.788
And he played ball with me.

00:52:05.789 --> 00:52:06.998
Sure.

00:52:07.791 --> 00:52:09.584
He definitely had his moments.

00:52:09.668 --> 00:52:11.753
Once in a blue moon, when he wasn't drunk.

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:18.343
Why in the world

00:52:19.636 --> 00:52:23.098
did you hide this
when you confessed to your crimes?

00:52:26.142 --> 00:52:28.770
How can you even call yourself human?

00:52:28.854 --> 00:52:32.774
You use your child as an excuse
for the crimes you committed.

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:36.611
Why did you keep this hidden until now?

00:52:36.695 --> 00:52:38.697
Why the hell did you do that for?

00:52:39.281 --> 00:52:42.701
Well, the thing is, nobody asked about it.

00:52:43.285 --> 00:52:44.286
What?

00:52:44.369 --> 00:52:46.705
You couldn't remember
what happened that day.

00:52:48.039 --> 00:52:50.417
So, I said he walked out on us
for another woman

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:52.919
and everyone just sort of
didn't question it…

00:52:57.799 --> 00:52:59.968
Is this really on me?

00:53:58.443 --> 00:54:00.195
I used to watch cats

00:54:00.278 --> 00:54:02.072
hunt birds when I was little.

00:54:03.156 --> 00:54:05.200
The birds couldn't fly,
but they didn't die, either.

00:54:08.286 --> 00:54:10.038
The birds weren't food to them.

00:54:10.622 --> 00:54:13.375
When the bird with the broken wing
or some other injury

00:54:13.458 --> 00:54:16.169
would try to move again, the hunt resumed.

00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:18.964
But it will die in the end,

00:54:19.047 --> 00:54:21.049
so you have to save it
just before it does.

00:54:22.884 --> 00:54:25.804
If a little kid is trying to save a bird,

00:54:26.596 --> 00:54:27.722
they have to be careful.

00:54:28.348 --> 00:54:30.266
If you clutch it too tightly,

00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:31.601
it'll die.

00:54:32.936 --> 00:54:35.480
A slight squeeze on the breastbone

00:54:35.563 --> 00:54:36.690
will make it snap like that.

00:54:38.233 --> 00:54:39.901
They're so fragile.

00:54:41.569 --> 00:54:44.489
But you know,
humans are not much different.

00:55:11.349 --> 00:55:12.517
My husband

00:55:13.476 --> 00:55:14.519
is dead.

00:55:33.621 --> 00:55:34.956
It's really easy

00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:36.666
to kill another person.

00:55:37.667 --> 00:55:38.918
But the issue lies in

00:55:39.002 --> 00:55:41.254
the disposal of the body
and the cleanup after it.

00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:45.050
That…

00:55:46.051 --> 00:55:47.135
is just hard labor.

00:55:49.888 --> 00:55:51.598
It's so hard.

00:55:53.183 --> 00:55:54.768
That's when I first realized it.

00:55:54.851 --> 00:55:57.896
Killing someone isn't hard.

00:55:57.979 --> 00:56:02.067
The hard parts are
tying up loose ends and cleaning up.

00:56:03.985 --> 00:56:05.487
However, that day,

00:56:06.446 --> 00:56:07.989
luck was really on my side.

00:56:41.981 --> 00:56:43.691
It starts raining right after I kill him?

00:56:55.453 --> 00:56:58.331
That's how I found peace.

00:56:59.999 --> 00:57:01.751
Jeong-ho and I

00:57:03.336 --> 00:57:05.255
found happiness together.

00:57:20.103 --> 00:57:21.312
You were at peace?

00:57:24.774 --> 00:57:25.775
After that,

00:57:27.068 --> 00:57:28.069
you managed to kill

00:57:29.863 --> 00:57:31.448
five more people.

00:57:32.365 --> 00:57:34.117
They deserved to die? No.

00:57:34.868 --> 00:57:37.996
You killed them
simply because you wanted to kill.

00:57:38.079 --> 00:57:39.414
After your first kill,

00:57:40.039 --> 00:57:42.083
after you killed my dad,

00:57:42.876 --> 00:57:44.169
you must have developed

00:57:44.752 --> 00:57:46.463
a lust for blood. Am I wrong?

00:57:51.468 --> 00:57:53.219
I can't really deny that.

00:58:05.565 --> 00:58:06.524
You…

00:58:10.361 --> 00:58:12.572
are a butcher who relishes
the scent of blood.

00:58:13.615 --> 00:58:14.699
The Mantis.

00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:18.620
Nothing but a monster.

00:58:23.625 --> 00:58:24.667
Yeah.

00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:28.588
That day,

00:58:29.672 --> 00:58:31.966
I shouldn't have done that.

00:58:34.135 --> 00:58:36.387
I lucked out. It rained.

00:58:36.471 --> 00:58:38.097
There happened to be a well nearby.

00:58:38.181 --> 00:58:41.643
I wasn't able to see it through
because I was so worried about you.

00:58:42.227 --> 00:58:45.396
I should've picked off
each of his appendages one by one.

00:58:46.022 --> 00:58:48.107
- That's enough.
- His head would've been last.

00:58:48.191 --> 00:58:49.025
Be quiet.

00:58:49.108 --> 00:58:51.569
He needs to be able to watch
his body be picked apart.

00:58:54.531 --> 00:58:57.408
I was sloppy because it was my first time.

00:59:00.495 --> 00:59:03.623
So sloppy, I didn't even want
to tell the cops about it.

00:59:08.670 --> 00:59:10.463
Please just stop.

00:59:10.547 --> 00:59:12.298
Just be quiet. That's enough.

00:59:13.508 --> 00:59:14.425
How?

00:59:15.343 --> 00:59:16.386
How can you be so cruel?

00:59:17.887 --> 00:59:20.014
Yes, I killed your dad.

00:59:20.098 --> 00:59:22.100
I cut off a rotten bastard's tongue,

00:59:22.183 --> 00:59:23.351
snapped the neck of another,

00:59:23.434 --> 00:59:25.687
and pureed the joints of yet another
to make a fine mush.

00:59:25.770 --> 00:59:26.980
I did that.

00:59:31.693 --> 00:59:33.194
Do you hate me?

00:59:36.072 --> 00:59:37.115
Do you find me despicable?

00:59:42.161 --> 00:59:43.413
Do you want to kill me?

00:59:46.624 --> 00:59:49.544
Your life would be so much easier
if I just disappeared.

00:59:57.176 --> 00:59:58.011
Kill me.

00:59:58.094 --> 00:59:59.512
You should just kill me.

01:00:01.306 --> 01:00:02.849
You find me revolting, don't you?

01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:04.684
How nice would it be
if I just disappeared?

01:00:04.767 --> 01:00:06.936
Go on. Kill me.

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:09.022
Just kill me here and now.

01:00:09.105 --> 01:00:12.650
My dear son, having your mother stay alive
is such a crushing burden on you.

01:00:12.734 --> 01:00:13.610
Stop it.

01:01:03.618 --> 01:01:06.079
{\an8}By chance, do you remember any of them?

01:01:06.162 --> 01:01:07.246
{\an8}Dad, what are you doing?

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:08.873
{\an8}Are you Jeong I-shin's daughter-in-law?

01:01:08.956 --> 01:01:10.792
{\an8}Do you know Jeong I-shin?

01:01:10.875 --> 01:01:12.043
{\an8}And even at the hospital.

01:01:12.126 --> 01:01:14.170
{\an8}What is he? The god of investigations?

01:01:14.253 --> 01:01:16.047
{\an8}He does get it right every time.

01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:17.173
{\an8}Jeong-ho.

01:01:17.256 --> 01:01:19.509
{\an8}Park Min-jae's car is in front
of my place right now.

01:01:19.592 --> 01:01:21.052
{\an8}She's going to kill.

01:01:21.135 --> 01:01:23.971
{\an8}Why is Jeong I-shin trying to kill you?

01:01:24.055 --> 01:01:26.974
{\an8}This bastard had been spying
on Jung-yeon and me this whole time.

01:01:27.558 --> 01:01:28.434
{\an8}You killed them.

01:01:29.102 --> 01:01:30.311
{\an8}You killed them all, didn't you?

01:01:30.395 --> 01:01:34.607
