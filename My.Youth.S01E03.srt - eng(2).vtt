00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.430
(Song Joong Ki)

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.140
(Chun Woo Hee)

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.570
(Lee Joo Myung)

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.580
(Seo Ji Hun)

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.960
(My Youth)

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.330
I'd be lying...

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.300
if I said I never thought about you.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.570
Quite the opposite.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.340
Like an overplayed cassette tape,

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.350
I'd replay those moments in my head until they were completely worn out.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.420
Seeing you again,

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.760
you instantly took me right back to that time.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.890
As if teasing me.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.600
When I could find nothing...

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.440
to refer to in any of the pages.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:39.970
To that time.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.920
My path wasn't so dark.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.530
Thanks to you.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.969
Team Leader Sung Je Yeon, the next script.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.970
Yes.

00:02:12.971 --> 00:02:14.939
It's a historical fantasy romance.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.069
It's pre-produced for streaming,

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.239
and it's Director Han Seok Won's first series.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.409
It's based on the folktale, "The Fairy and the Woodcutter."

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.150
The main character is a palace seamstress.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.019
She enters an embroidery competition at the palace,

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.820
and the clothing is stolen by the woodcutter, the male lead...

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.849
Isn't he just a straight-up thief?

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.660
Well, the woodcutter was a thief in the original story, too.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.419
Who's in talks for the male lead again?

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.759
Pyo Mun Su.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.899
He was a top model, and this is his acting debut.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.769
Well, good for him for trying. Tell him to work hard. Next.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.029
This next one is an in-house project.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.369
It's from "The Sun and the Moon," the "give-me-a-rice-cake" story.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.440
You all know that one, right?

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.670
I thought the premise for this one was interesting.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.509
Turning "The Sun and the Moon" into a space opera is quite a take.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.480
But isn't the concept a little too much?

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.779
What is this guy, a complete pig?

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.819
He's not a tiger, is he? He's a pig.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.019
And he's in a time loop just to keep eating rice cakes?

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.190
- Just how many is he scarfing down? - They must have been tasty.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.459
Visit the set for a day and give notes on the rice cake scenes.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.060
Get Hae Yeong in here for this one and have her read it by today.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.570
And have Tae Rin do the daily drama.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.099
Ma'am, that doesn't start filming for another month.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.139
And she's not even done with her current project.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.109
Once she's done with her current project,

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.309
shouldn't she get to take a bit of a break?

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.479
She's an adult, on her third series. We need to solidify her brand...

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.320
What, did you two rehearse this?

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.120
We're not that close, ma'am.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.660
Let's move on.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.170
Excuse me, ma'am.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.469
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.039
It's just that Tae Rin has only been doing historical dramas,

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.279
and since this is her first contemporary role,

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.279
I was hoping she could shed that typecast image.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.310
Is he your boyfriend?

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.779
The guy whose clothes you ripped in front of the office yesterday.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.280
Oh, him...

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.520
I apologise for causing a scene in front of the office.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:10.920
Was that too personal?

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.760
I thought we were close enough, Je Yeon.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.429
Well...

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.159
The man from yesterday... His name is Sunwoo Hae.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.300
Does that name ring a bell?

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.430
I see.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.670
Let's see, what was he in?

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.239
Beat or Bebop or something? That kid?

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.140
Oh, of course, you remember.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.409
Tae Rin and I actually went to the same school as him,

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.210
and my senior colleague, So Ra, asked me for a favour...

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.219
Producer Jin So Ra. We went to college together.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.179
That award-winning pilot was her debut. I know her.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.819
Yes, with her,

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.759
that two-part documentary that got shelved last year...

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.420
I was thinking we could try and revive it.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.330
It would be a short shoot,

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.599
and it's rare to find a nice project that isn't chasing sensationalism.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.400
You really like "nice" projects, don't you, Team Leader Sung?

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:54.900
Draft up a proposal.

00:04:54.901 --> 00:04:56.100
Thank you, ma'am.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.670
What a relief.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.710
"I'm really sorry, but..."

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.349
"Hearing you call me takes me back."

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.780
"You only call me sir these days."

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.250
"You really haven't changed a bit."

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:15.820
All done?

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.189
- Yes. - Want to take a quick break?

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.060
- Sounds good. - Oh, sure.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:25.929
Well...

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.299
You know the screenwriter, Ahn So Jin, right?

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.440
Everything she writes gets over 30 percent in ratings.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.499
"My Annoying Daughter"

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.209
That title is so annoying.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.709
Do people even say "annoying" anymore?

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.910
The only slight issue is,

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.209
the shoot starts in a month,

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.980
and it's 50 episodes, so it'll be a physical grind.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.679
But didn't you say you were tired of historical dramas?

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.950
This is a contemporary story, set in the 2020s.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.660
So this is what all my offers are like now?

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.390
Starting in a month...

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.360
I wonder how many people passed on this.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.099
If you're up for it, instead of "My Annoying Daughter,"

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.969
I think the two-part documentary might be a better option.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.200
You know, the one with Sunwoo Hae back then.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.140
You know the project doesn't work without you.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.640
It couldn't happen without me?

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.040
It was scrapped without Sunwoo Hae, but now that he's found, it'll work.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.750
Tae Rin.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:18.880
Hey, Tae Rin.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.330
Where are you going by yourself?

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.430
To go buy bubbles.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.030
I saw a stationery shop nearby.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.640
If you want to go for a smoke, I already found a hidden spot.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.380
Why do I feel like blowing bubbles right now of all times?

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.690
I know you're worried about them dredging up the "child actor" thing.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:59.720
"She's not as good as she was as a kid."

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.729
"She's stuck in her childhood roles."

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:03.130
This project is perfect for that.

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.399
Even at my age, whatever I do, I still get the "child actor" label.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.599
It makes me want to throw up.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.870
A nostalgic trip with the co-star who's the very symbol of that label?

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.639
Isn't that just torture?

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.570
But the person you were back then is still a part of you.

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:19.310
I thought you were amazing then, and you're still amazing now.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:20.910
What was that?

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.020
You're not the type to say cheesy things like that, Je Yeon.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:25.850
Did you get struck by lightning?

00:07:25.851 --> 00:07:27.050
Should I go get struck by it now?

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.830
Gosh. You're so cute, you almost had me there.

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.130
My true self...

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:45.969
I don't have the confidence to show it.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:49.469
Don't draw such a hard line. Why not blend them a little?

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:50.810
I mean, it's all scripted anyway.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.509
You could just add a little extra something.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:55.680
What would you mix in?

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:00.279
My wisdom and sagacity?

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.050
That's a brilliant idea.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.790
You can be anything you want to be.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.160
But what's the deal with Sunwoo Hae?

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.860
I thought he said he wouldn't do it.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.430
Who knows.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.670
He must have had a change of heart.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:18.800
Apparently, he wants to get rich.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.250
Feeling a little better?

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.850
Should I give you some space?

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:33.920
Come with me.

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:42.360
Did you have a price range in mind?

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:46.059
To make a full bouquet with the flowers you've chosen,

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.699
it would be around 70 dollars.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.130
Could you make it 50, please?

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:51.970
I can't spend more than that. Not on that...

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:54.670
That person.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:57.780
I'll make sure it looks full.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:00.210
But...

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:03.450
You broke up, but he invited you to his solo exhibition?

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:06.480
I wonder if this is what he's trying to say.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.189
"A new beginning."

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.019
No, I don't want a new beginning with him.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.020
I see.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.120
Okay.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:15.790
"The impossible."

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.959
I'll make this work for 50 dollars.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.030
You've become a smooth operator.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.040
What?

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:28.810
It's adorable.

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.420
I hope it makes a great gift.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.120
- Please come again. - Thank you.

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:49.890
You're a natural at sales.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.570
What?

00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:59.970
You look pretty today.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.009
I came here to ask you something, and I almost forgot what it was.

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.010
Is your beauty that shocking?

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.320
You've got a certain presence about you.

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.350
- What? - For one, you know flower meanings.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.459
That?

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:19.959
I read this book until it fell apart.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.330
It was on their origins and history.

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:23.830
To think you never cracked a book for school.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.369
I just wonder, why do people buy flowers?

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:28.629
Hey, now.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:30.100
That's a bit harsh.

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:33.040
- Why won't they? - Of course, they buy them.

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:34.770
Just not for themselves.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.179
They're always going to performances to congratulate people.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.210
Tae Rin does, too.

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:45.849
Since blue roses don't occur naturally...

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:47.590
they were originally a symbol of the impossible.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:51.659
But once genetically engineered, their meaning changed.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:53.059
So what did it change to?

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:54.429
Curious enough to buy one and find out?

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:55.629
And do what with it?

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.230
You can figure that out after you buy it.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.170
That sounded too much like a sales pitch, didn't it?

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.799
No, I mean, who gave flowers their meanings in the first place?

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.309
The people trying to sell them, of course.

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:09.870
Exactly. For whose benefit?

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.380
The florists, that's who.

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:17.450
Anyway, about the shoot...

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:20.850
Let's just say we're old high school friends.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.219
- So you play along. - And what should I say?

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.020
That we're high school friends who kissed?

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:28.830
Hey, you!

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:30.430
Hey.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.730
Technically, that's not what happened, all right?

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.629
It wasn't, but if you say anything...

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:36.270
I'm not kidding, you'll regret it.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.340
You pick the date for the meeting. Any day works.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.809
I've decided to get along with you.

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:45.140
At least until filming is over.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:46.679
Let's not get on each other's nerves.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.009
Depends on how you act.

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:50.010
You might even end up respecting me.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:00.660
Look at you.

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:03.190
Take a good long look.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.200
All right.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:08.500
I'm off.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.040
Go on, then.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:19.680
Welcome.

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:25.349
Here for some flowers?

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:28.249
Yes. I'm just going to browse for a bit.

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:29.250
I'm waiting for someone.

00:12:29.251 --> 00:12:31.320
Oh, of course. Take your time.

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:41.599
Excuse me, are you a producer?

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.200
Me? Yes.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.969
- What? - Hey.

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:48.269
- Oh, you're here. - Sung Je Yeon.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:50.739
Where is he? I said, where is he?

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.709
If you're messing with me,

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:54.510
I swear, you're going to pay for this.

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:56.749
You want to know why? Because yesterday,

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:59.649
- I pulled an all-nighter, you hear? - The coffee! Over there.

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:01.120
It's Sunwoo Hae. Right there.

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:02.690
Right there.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.730
I said any day, and you really took me up on it right away.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.499
Hello, I'm Sunwoo Hae.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:14.700
Wait, what's this? What happened?

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:19.169
I'm Jin So Ra.

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:20.599
Gosh!

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.440
I wasn't expecting to meet you like this.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:23.909
Gosh!

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:26.639
Look how much you've grown!

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.279
I mean it, you're huge! Bebop, you used to be this tiny.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.550
And now you're all grown up...

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:34.390
I was a huge fan of "Beat and Bebop"

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:37.890
Who knew I'd get so big, right?

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:41.789
Anyway, thank you for coming.

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:42.989
No, I should be thanking you.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:44.859
No, really, thank you.

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.100
Oh, my gosh!

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.429
Oh, I...

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:51.370
I have to put my project on hold and revise this segment.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.439
This project is really important to me.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.870
Please don't change your mind.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.780
Then make me not want to.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.709
Right, I just stepped out for a moment.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:06.879
If any issues come up, Je Yeon here will be in touch.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.220
Okay.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:09.750
See you soon.

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:12.160
Leaving? I'll go with you.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.260
Let's do a great job.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.430
Hey, Sung Je Yeon.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:32.110
She just comes and goes as she pleases.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:33.880
Always doing whatever she wants.

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:41.990
You called for me?

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:43.220
Hi.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.790
Looks like you set our meetings to overlap.

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:46.690
I got here a little early.

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:48.259
Should I give you two some space?

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:49.830
I read the report you submitted.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.560
But you left out the issue with Yu Je Il.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.430
We're currently coordinating a meeting date.

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:56.430
And as for "My Annoying Daughter," the filming schedule...

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.500
I decided the schedule would be too physically demanding for her.

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:01.439
This is Tae Rin's first documentary.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.070
Does she have to share the spotlight with some non-celebrity?

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:05.879
I have a feeling once this airs,

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.380
people will talk more about Sunwoo Hae.

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:11.550
Because he's been off the radar since he was 13.

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:13.350
Because he vanished so dramatically.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:14.990
Which makes people curious.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.760
Since he's a non-celebrity, it's hard to create follow-up buzz,

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.290
so I prioritised Tae Rin.

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:25.100
Because that's what's best for the company and for you, ma'am.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.999
Why would he bother to be on TV now at his age?

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.870
It makes you wonder. Is it for the money?

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:33.699
Just give me your approval,

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.140
and I'll be on set for every shoot and handle everything personally.

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.440
Don't let him get too close to Tae Rin.

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.310
And don't let him pull any stunts for a comeback or personal gain.

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.820
You brought him in, so it's on you to keep him in line.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:48.190
And keep a close eye on Sunwoo Hae during the entire shoot.

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:50.850
Yes, ma'am.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.699
Mom, why have you always hated him so much?

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.930
I have? When? Just now?

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.769
Why on earth would I hate him?

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:07.640
If it's a good idea, why not just do it?

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:09.840
Do his motives really matter?

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:15.410
That's a good point.

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:18.650
You're pretty sharp.

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:27.730
There it is. That prickly side.

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:30.890
I'm so sick and tired of it.

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:54.950
He looks worse in person than on TV.

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:02.490
Hey, what are we going to do?

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:04.459
The baby just won't cry.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:05.629
Tell me about it.

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:07.500
He has to cry for us to use the footage.

00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:15.340
Excuse me! Coming through. Hey!

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:22.610
- A debt collector? - Hey, get the shot! Quick!

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:35.560
You should've paid me back!

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:38.430
Sunwoo Hae's story...

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:41.170
is ideal for gossip, don't you think?

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:44.400
He was the face of that fraud case.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.840
His mother even took her own life because she lost hope.

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:55.680
So?

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:58.080
What are you so worried about?

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:00.020
It's just...

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:03.590
It seems good, even to me, but I'm worried it'll get tainted.

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:06.320
You know, Mom,

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.589
you sound like you're talking about Sunwoo Hae when he was 13.

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:09.860
The way you feel sorry for him.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:11.960
I do?

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.469
Pity him? Why would I?

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:17.670
Thinking only of your actress, this is a great opportunity.

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:21.670
People who watch the show will say that Mo Tae Rin turned out so well.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.040
All thanks to Sunwoo Hae.

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:25.040
But that's not what you were just thinking, was it?

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.810
It's as if you've gone back to that time.

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.220
This documentary is going to be a hit.

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.220
I've got to go. I need to get back to the office.

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:44.599
Art Director!

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:45.930
Excuse me, coming through.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.640
Producer, you said today was just supposed to be our first meeting.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:58.880
But you show up with cameras and a whole crew...

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.480
We're doing two things at once. To save some time.

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:06.079
We figured we could get a little screen test done while we're at it.

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.080
Hello.

00:19:07.081 --> 00:19:08.990
I'm Jung Ji Hye, the writer for the show.

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:10.220
Hello.

00:19:10.221 --> 00:19:11.789
And this is our junior writer.

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:12.790
Hello.

00:19:12.791 --> 00:19:14.090
I trust you've seen the proposal?

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:16.859
Yes, but I must admit I didn't quite understand what it was about.

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.699
Well, that's the thing about television.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:22.070
Until it actually airs, no one knows how it will turn out.

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:24.799
Let's get shots of the inside. What are you waiting for?

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.000
Yes, on it.

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:31.780
What are you making?

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:33.710
I'm blooming it.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.680
You said this was just a test, so I'm keeping it simple.

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:39.379
Ma'am, they said Mo Tae Rin has arrived.

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:41.590
Okay, go and say your hellos.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:46.559
Hello. Hi, everyone.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:51.429
- Hello. - Hi.

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:53.830
- Hello. - Hey.

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:55.600
Hello.

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:57.270
What?

00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:59.600
You two should be saying hi to each other.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.210
Weren't you two the national siblings?

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:05.580
We have the National Little Sister, Mo Tae Rin.

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:08.410
And the National Little Brother, Sunwoo Hae.

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:10.780
Your characters' names were Beat and Bebop, was it?

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:12.349
What?

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:13.480
Wait, you're Bebop?

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:19.189
What happened to you?

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:20.919
What's that supposed to mean?

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.889
I just meant you've grown so much, I almost didn't recognise you.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:27.130
Well, you should have just said that, then.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.270
Your personality hasn't changed a bit, though.

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:34.270
What?

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:35.410
Hey, Bebop.

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:38.740
A bit informal, aren't we?

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:43.280
Hey, Beat.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:45.380
Hey!

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:49.790
The TV stars from my childhood are right here in front of me.

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:51.250
I knew it.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:54.690
This is so moving.

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:57.430
Wait, are these artificial?

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.469
They're real flowers, preserved and dyed so they won't wilt.

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:02.530
Oh, I see.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.340
Is that why they're so expensive? Counting the labour and all.

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:08.540
Well, it can't be cheap if it's made to last forever.

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:09.910
Right.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.410
- Je Yeon, I... - Yes.

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:19.750
She's scary sometimes.

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:26.960
I figured you might be thirsty.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.499
By any chance,

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.170
do any of your customers recognise you?

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:45.710
Because I recognised you right away.

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:47.510
But you didn't recognise me.

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:51.480
Should we try it before the first shoot?

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.190
Could I just ask you for one favour?

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.119
- Sorry? - Oh, it's just...

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.089
You could just stroll in like a customer...

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:00.960
- and act shy when you see him. - Right.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:04.530
You're not quite sure if it's him, and you're all... You know?

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:07.999
I just can't, for the life of me,

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.570
bring myself to act shy in front of him.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.540
Just try to act shy.

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:15.670
I'll play along.

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:21.750
Oh, it's Bebop.

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:24.679
Wait. Bebop...

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.120
Sorry, let me try that again.

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:27.880
You're Bebop, right?

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:32.490
You are Bebop, aren't you?

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:38.400
Even if I was, you're making me not want to say so.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:42.170
Okay, let me try again with a little more feeling.

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:44.200
Wait a second. Aren't you the child actor, Sunwoo Hae?

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:46.040
But you already knew I was here when you walked in.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.910
Oh, my goodness.

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:56.450
Oh, my gosh, it is you. It really is.

00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:59.050
The youngest-ever Best Actor Award winner!

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.520
Oh, my.

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:03.719
Gosh, so if you just add "Oh, my,"

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:04.890
it makes you all shy all of a sudden?

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:08.529
You said you'd play along. Why aren't you, sir?

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:10.229
It's not as easy as it looks.

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:11.699
I mean, besides, in this situation,

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.530
wouldn't our Tae Rin be the one people notice first?

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:15.630
Actually, never mind.

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:17.769
I guess I'm too big for my britches.

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:18.800
I used to do it all and not complain.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.899
I'll try again and do it right.

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:21.910
No.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.310
We're better off cutting this.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:27.910
How humiliating.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:30.810
One, two, three!

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:32.450
Action!

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:36.249
- Tear this open, Tae Rin. - Okay.

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:38.160
- Then pour it in here. - Okay.

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:50.800
That's it.

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:52.800
Just mix it together.

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:54.970
There you go. You're doing great.

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:57.910
Of course, I am. This part's a piece of cake.

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:01.950
- All right, keep stirring. - Okay.

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:18.960
Okay, now take that out.

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.230
Take it out like this.

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:24.600
Okay.

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:26.669
Break it up and mix it in together.

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:27.670
Okay.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:22.960
Hey, Sunwoo Hae.

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:30.700
Hey, Sunwoo Hae.

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:36.940
Are you okay?

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:42.510
I'm fine.

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:44.480
Oh, good.

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:47.219
Try not to look directly into the camera.

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:50.920
If you can, try to look off to the side like that.

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:52.320
Got it.

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:58.530
- Great work. - Great work.

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:02.829
You all should hang out when you have time.

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:04.230
It'll make for a better final product.

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:06.769
The bickering between Beat and Bebop...

00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:08.439
I'm sure tons of people want to see that.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.970
Then let's go to Geon No's place. The one we went to last time.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:18.109
Oh, we have a night scene to shoot, so we have to get to the set...

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:19.120
I see.

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.450
Well, that's a shame. Let's just drop him off on our way.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.920
That's okay, right?

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:26.519
- Get home safe. - Okay, great work today.

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.459
- Great work. - Great work.

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:29.460
Good job.

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.160
Yes, get home safe.

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:40.040
Hey, Sunwoo Hae.

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:42.570
Are you really going to talk about personal stuff like that?

00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:45.109
What were you thinking, saying, "The place we went to last time?"

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:47.280
Oh, so that was personal?

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:50.450
My mistake. I thought it was official business.

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:55.590
I heard you were in the same class. You must have been really close.

00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:59.519
Were we?

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.559
I don't know. I don't remember.

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.029
What's the definition of "close" anyway?

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:04.959
I don't know. In my book, we weren't.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.259
I asked Mo Tae Rin, you know. You said you don't remember.

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.900
I don't!

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:10.600
Right.

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:15.469
But when I messed up digging earlier and got dirt all over myself,

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:16.840
didn't I look like a total idiot?

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:18.439
Tae Rin.

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.410
You have no idea how adorable you looked.

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:22.279
You were absolutely adorable.

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.880
Let's be honest. You did look kind of dumb.

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:27.650
- Shut it. - Yes, you were the bigger idiot.

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:29.390
Fine.

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:32.120
It's strange, now that I think about it.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:35.090
How did we never once run into each other at school?

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:36.860
I avoided you.

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:40.360
I figured nothing good would come of being seen with you.

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:41.830
What's that supposed to mean?

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:43.470
What?

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:46.500
What?

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:49.570
I'm going to buy a shovel.

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:53.339
I'll practice in my free time at home. I want to get good at it.

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:54.540
At what, digging yourself into a hole?

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:56.780
Can I swear?

00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:58.920
Go for it.

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:00.550
I'm good at swearing now.

00:28:00.551 --> 00:28:01.950
No, don't, Tae Rin.

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:03.620
She said not to.

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:06.319
To think a little kid like you knows how to swear.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:07.989
Hey, don't egg her on.

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.990
Go on.

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:18.800
- Go on. - Bye.

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.510
- Wait a second. - Okay.

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:26.980
Hey, Sunwoo Hae.

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:35.990
You had a panic attack earlier, didn't you?

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:41.090
I know a psychiatrist, if you want to talk to someone.

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:42.830
I haven't been on camera in a while.

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:44.690
I guess I was a little rusty.

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:46.629
I'll be more careful next time.

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:50.530
I heard you've been turning down all your offers for TV shows.

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:54.439
What's with the change of heart, deciding to be in this?

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.409
What's with all the questions?

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:58.480
After all that sweet-talking you did to get me to sign on?

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:00.880
I'm leaving.

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:23.630
Why are you writing your shop's log in my shop?

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:26.139
I figured if I stayed to finish,

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:28.000
they'd leave without giving me a ride.

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:30.640
Gosh, I'm two days behind.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.540
Hey, hurry up and finish.

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:37.180
Hey.

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:39.920
What do you think of a guy in debt?

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.219
- Is he pretty? - You could say that.

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:43.819
- Is he young? - He's of a certain age.

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:46.060
A pretty guy who's in debt and of a certain age.

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:48.730
He's not my type at all. What are you getting at?

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:50.790
Just a little self-assessment.

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:53.200
So, what's the verdict?

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:56.530
That firefighter with you...

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:58.740
was our old class president, wasn't she?

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:00.540
What's the story there?

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:02.309
She just showed up out of the blue.

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:05.069
And not to sell you insurance, or run some kind of scam?

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:06.410
Like, with a pure heart?

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:11.510
I wonder.

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:17.920
I don't think it would have mattered what her intentions were.

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.620
She was always really good to me when we were kids.

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:24.189
If it hadn't been for Sung Je Yeon, back in high school, I would've...

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:26.099
And who looked out for you all through high school?

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:27.660
- Me! That's who! - Welcome.

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:29.429
Hey, I was in the middle of talking.

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:30.500
Welcome.

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.940
A salad? Are you on a diet?

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.440
Yes.

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:39.879
The director said, "Who'd protect a big girl like you?"

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.949
Gosh. That's ridiculous.

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:44.150
Who's protecting whom? My character is the one who's dying.

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:46.650
It is a romantic comedy, though.

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.049
You guys go on and eat.

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:50.920
You've been dragged into this diet with me.

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:52.259
But please,

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:55.119
eat something sinful for me. I mean something seriously decadent.

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:57.089
The kind of thing that's so good it could kill you both.

00:30:57.090 --> 00:30:58.960
- All right, calm down. - Something like that.

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:00.430
Here.

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:03.030
Je Yeon.

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.400
- Can I talk to you for a second? - Yes.

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:09.670
- Keep eating. - Okay.

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:11.140
Go on.

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:16.180
Hey, what does Je Yeon like?

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:18.550
Je Yeon...

00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:21.280
likes me. Why do you ask?

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:24.320
Eat up.

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:30.460
We're putting out a press release for the new programming schedule.

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:33.699
- And our show is the main feature. - Oh, nice!

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:36.400
So I have to write a quick summary and pass it along.

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:39.969
And I'm sure they'll ask about Bebop...

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:42.970
Oh, you'll mention Tae Rin too, right?

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:45.710
I'll ask the PR team for materials.

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:46.840
Oh, sure.

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:48.949
As for Bebop,

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:51.280
since you're close, could you get his for me?

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:52.350
We're not close.

00:31:52.351 --> 00:31:53.680
Well, you're closer to him than I am.

00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:58.350
You know, about Bebop...

00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:00.560
I was a little worried, to be honest.

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:04.630
Since he has such a dark past, I thought he'd be a downer.

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:07.730
I see.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.230
Well, I...

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:15.239
I guess I've never really thought of him that way.

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.310
High school classmates?

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:17.840
What was he like back then?

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:21.239
Well, now he speaks his mind freely, which I actually find refreshing.

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:22.479
He doesn't seem to hold things in.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:25.480
I guess he was pretty similar back then.

00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:28.720
Maybe a bit cuter than he is now?

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.620
No, not at all.

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:37.260
Not at all.

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:40.460
Are there any must-try restaurants around here?

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:42.770
I wouldn't know.

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:47.300
So, where are we going then?

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.270
I thought you knew where we were going.

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:56.110
Let's get this over with quickly and head back.

00:32:57.450 --> 00:32:58.450
Gosh.

00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:03.490
What happened to "let's get along?" Did it just vanish into thin air?

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:06.190
Stop playing dumb.

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.459
There's no way you don't know the good spots around here.

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:10.830
Well, you pretended not to know me at first.

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:14.300
Are we really bringing this up now?

00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:31.510
Do you tend to hold a grudge?

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:34.379
For the record, I can hold a grudge for a long time.

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:36.819
It wasn't that I was pretending not to know you.

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:39.260
I just couldn't find the right time to say hi.

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:42.160
That's the same thing.

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:46.000
So Ra said you're not what she expected.

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:48.800
That you're so direct and outspoken, and that you don't hold grudges.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.200
My foot.

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.340
Maybe it's all the resentment I bottled up as a kid?

00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:58.640
Back then, even when off-camera, I always felt like I was performing.

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:02.349
Trying to impress the adults,

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:04.580
I was always reading the room and calculating what to say.

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:07.580
But ever since I quit,

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:11.250
I've wanted to live my life just saying whatever I want.

00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:19.000
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:21.330
And how am I looking at you?

00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:25.200
"You're grown up and still whining. How pathetic."

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:27.269
That kind of look?

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:28.870
No, I'm just relieved.

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:33.279
Our producer is preparing a press release,

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.449
and it seems they need an update on you or something.

00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:37.510
An update starting from when, exactly?

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:42.520
Since the setting is a flower shop, maybe from after came of age?

00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:45.150
You published that book when you were 20, right?

00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:47.659
But it seems you didn't continue writing novels.

00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:50.289
I'm wondering if we should include that or leave it out.

00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:51.960
No. Definitely leave it out.

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:53.360
Why?

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.530
It's way cooler than just "He became a florist."

00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:00.270
The whole "writing novels surrounded by flowers" image.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.510
Just hearing you say that makes me cringe so hard.

00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:07.340
It sounds kind of annoying.

00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:09.309
That's hilarious.

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:10.579
You think it's funny?

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:11.610
No, it's not funny.

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:13.520
Not funny at all.

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:26.700
A day like this will never come again.

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:30.000
And yet, because we were together,

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:31.700
I couldn't be happier.

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:36.310
The chewing is so loud. What are we supposed to do about it?

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:37.809
This is supposed to be an emotional scene.

00:35:37.810 --> 00:35:39.280
Oh, how can I say that to him?

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:47.820
Gosh.

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:50.390
I can't believe she can get into character with that noise.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:53.960
Excuse me.

00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:57.660
I can't do this anymore.

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:01.499
I'm really sorry, but...

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:04.229
Hearing you call me takes me back.

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:08.140
Could you please not smack your lips so loudly?

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:12.039
- I noticed... - Tae Rin.

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:14.610
- you're quiet when you swallow. - Please, don't.

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:18.610
Can't you just swallow it whole?

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:24.690
I don't think that's possible.

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:30.329
You've been smacking your lips for several takes now.

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:32.399
It's completely taking me out of the scene.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.060
Can't you, please?

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:44.410
I am so sorry!

00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:12.400
So, how did it go?

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:14.400
Is it that bad?

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:19.910
I smoothed things over, so don't worry about it.

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:24.009
You should've come to me first with something like that.

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:25.619
You can't just say that to an actor's face.

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:28.379
I mean, it's the last meal for a character who's about to die.

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:29.950
And he's devouring it with such gusto.

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:34.290
That's all I hear.

00:37:34.291 --> 00:37:36.289
Out of respect for the person who made the meal.

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:37.290
Eating with relish, right?

00:37:37.291 --> 00:37:40.359
And I'm over here starving on a diet because of him.

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:41.960
Good grief.

00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:45.800
Please.

00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:48.039
Let's just keep things positive.

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:51.370
And only say nice things, Ms. Mo, all right?

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:53.740
No more tears.

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:55.879
I'm done crying.

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:56.979
- You sure? - Yes.

00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:58.279
Does that mean you're getting into character?

00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:59.380
No, I'm just mad.

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:01.880
You smiled.

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:06.919
(Wanmi Jokbal)

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:09.729
So you're telling me you cried on set?

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:11.130
At 30 years old?

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:14.060
You were bawling your eyes out?

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:18.100
I didn't bawl. I just teared up a bit.

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.269
When I was a kid, crying always worked.

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:27.639
Even as a kid, being professional was always a struggle.

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:30.910
What does a kid have to be professional about?

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:34.449
At most, you just had to be polite and say your hellos.

00:38:34.450 --> 00:38:37.290
Just have fun on set, and you'd be fine.

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:39.320
You're really something else.

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:40.420
What?

00:38:40.421 --> 00:38:43.890
Your hair is a mess too. You should fix it.

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:47.130
No, not that spot.

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:49.930
No, the other side. Your left...

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:01.110
Done.

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:03.179
Then you should've just fixed it.

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:05.210
Well, I'm not your manager.

00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:09.319
For the record, my greetings were always top-notch.

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:10.719
Wasn't that the only thing you were good at?

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:12.149
No, I was good at greetings too.

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:13.489
- No. - Yes.

00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:15.459
- I said no! - And I said yes!

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:16.559
Hang on a second.

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:19.600
I like what you just did there. Let's try to go with that, okay?

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:22.499
For today's scene, the two of you...

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:25.069
are eating a spread of pork rinds and jokbal...

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:26.399
and having some drinks with it.

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:28.870
The idea is that you're having a heart-to-heart.

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:31.610
But let's go with that bickering vibe you just had.

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.509
What exactly did you like about it?

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:35.580
Didn't I come off like a total loser?

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.010
That's what's so charming about it.

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:41.720
When your real self comes out, Tae Rin, you're really fun to watch.

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:46.919
If you can show me a bit of that, it'll help build your characters.

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:49.659
And I'll be sure to capture all the right moments.

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:50.660
Okay.

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.759
Oh, but since I'm on a diet...

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.830
I might have to just drink on an empty stomach.

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.839
The producer's right. You're hilarious when you act like a loser.

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:03.209
That is not what she said.

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:04.370
Yes, she did.

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:08.140
Can you please tell him off?

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:12.049
You must've gotten in trouble a lot when you were a kid.

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:13.679
You just have that kind of face.

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:15.750
"Why do you keep making your little sister cry?"

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.849
But I didn't make you cry. You're the one who cried.

00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:21.290
I'm positive there were times you made me cry.

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:26.300
"I'm cold." "I'm hungry." "I'm sleepy." "I'm hot."

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:29.100
You never cried because of me.

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:32.940
Well, you've got a great memory.

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:36.310
Whatever. It's all in the past.

00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:38.770
I guess I'm still living through it.

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:41.479
Is it okay if I cuss today?

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:42.650
I said go for it.

00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:51.920
Je Yeon's been on the phone for a while.

00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:55.190
She must be getting a lot of calls because of today's article.

00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:57.029
The response has been good.

00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:58.729
I haven't read any of it.

00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:00.000
I'm too scared to see the comments.

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:03.900
Have you asked Je Yeon for advice on renewing your contract or not?

00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:06.770
Were you too scared to do that, too?

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:09.910
I feel like I'd just be burdening her, you know?

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:14.980
I think I need a change of scenery right now.

00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:17.609
If what you're looking for...

00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:20.280
isn't a shoulder to cry on,

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:22.320
but a guide, then don't worry.

00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:24.250
I'm great with directions.

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:30.560
- Okay. - Okay.

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:45.070
What if a burglar breaks in? Seriously.

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:48.980
I've noticed you're always here when I stop by after dinner.

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:50.710
What are you reading?

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:52.349
I don't know. Just...

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:53.450
whatever's here.

00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:55.749
At least look at the title.

00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:58.289
Don't just read it because it's there, like some little kid.

00:41:58.290 --> 00:41:59.290
Right.

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:03.390
Make sure you lock up properly for a while.

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.389
I might not be able to stop by on my days off.

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:07.230
That's nonsense.

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:10.870
I'm going to be on TV.

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:16.270
Yes, that's what ended up happening.

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:19.239
How did that end up happening?

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:21.410
There's someone I haven't been able to see all this time.

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:26.350
I figured if I do this, I might be able to see her more.

00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:29.249
She's helping to grease the wheels where it's broken down.

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:30.490
Oh, seriously.

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:32.920
You can't just decide I'm broken down.

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:36.429
You were trying to make ends meet while taking care of your sibling.

00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:39.260
You sacrificed your 20s. How could you possibly be fine?

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.299
I really hold it against your parents.

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:44.429
Gosh. Join the club.

00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:45.470
Hey!

00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:48.500
You can't agree with me! It's your filial duty!

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:52.210
They gave you life and raised you, for crying out loud!

00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:54.979
- Ma'am. - What is it?

00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:58.350
So, which tune am I supposed to dance to?

00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:02.720
Strike up the band

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:06.120
Grease those wheels properly.

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:07.860
And you know,

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:10.789
that's how you pay off your debts in life, I guess.

00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:13.060
- You have debts there too? - Oh, you know it.

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:15.699
A ton.

00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:16.830
They're huge.

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:20.699
By the way, do you really need an image of the sea?

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:22.909
I thought you said you were planting trees on a mountain.

00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:24.310
Well, the writer...

00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:26.579
said he thinks he'll need a shot of the sea.

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:28.479
Come on, it'll only take two days.

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:31.150
Okay, well, once the schedule's out, I'll share it with you.

00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:34.020
Okay. All right, bye.

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:38.749
- I'm here already, Producer. - Okay.

00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:40.459
How's that friend of yours doing?

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:41.519
He's fine.

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:43.889
My daughter asked if he'd look at something she wrote.

00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:45.760
And she'd also really like to meet and get his feedback in person.

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:47.700
But that might be too much to ask, right?

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:50.729
I'll ask him when I give him the draft.

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:51.929
I'll try to get him to agree.

00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:53.540
Oh, thank you so much.

00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:57.209
Oh, and by the way, about the co-host for our show...

00:43:57.210 --> 00:43:58.840
We're meeting with other candidates as well.

00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:02.480
We're going to meet them all and pick the one with the best vibe.

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:05.779
I'm counting on you for today's meeting as well.

00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:06.780
Of course.

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:14.660
This is our producer, Yu Je Il.

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:17.189
- Hello, I'm Mo Tae Rin. - A pleasure to meet you.

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:19.090
- Hello, I'm Director Bang Han Na. - A pleasure to meet you.

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:26.900
What... "Closed?"

00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:31.770
Why are we closed?

00:44:31.771 --> 00:44:32.940
Did we go out of business?

00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:41.150
(Currently delivering happiness. Emergency contact)

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:44.790
Putting up a "Closed" sign makes people think you went under.

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:48.760
Nu Ri, let's lose the heart.

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:51.160
- That's not going to work. - If not, let's remove "Happiness."

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:54.600
Hae, if we take out "Happiness," what's the point?

00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:56.799
I mean, how do you deliver happiness anyway?

00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:58.329
It's exaggerated.

00:44:58.330 --> 00:45:01.070
What? I guess you don't think it's false advertising?

00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:07.410
Hey, what's with all the stuff you bought?

00:45:07.610 --> 00:45:09.010
I didn't buy any of it, actually.

00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:11.480
Someone who likes me bought it all. Unlike someone I know.

00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:14.480
Who?

00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:16.020
Your boyfriend?

00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:18.950
The truth is, I bought it myself.

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:21.590
Hae! Just go inside already.

00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:24.459
I have lots of backed-up, you know, social media posts to upload.

00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:27.600
Hey, the only thing that's backed up is your studies, Nu Ri.

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.929
Or your whole life will fall behind! Hey, Eun Nu Ri!

00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:32.400
Not you and that doll again...

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:36.670
Thirty minutes until the wardrobe pickup.

00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:39.040
So, from the flower shop...

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:41.310
All the way there...

00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:46.480
Working through your meal, I see.

00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:48.320
Guess that's life as a lackey.

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:50.790
Stop trying to pick a fight...

00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:52.350
and have a smoke or something.

00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:54.220
Mr. CEO's Son.

00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:56.230
I'm not here for a smoke.

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:18.280
Hey, let's be honest. No one wanted to rep Mo Tae Rin.

00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:20.080
Not until Je Yeon stepped up.

00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:21.879
Even so...

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:24.150
Is Sung Je Yeon not thinking straight?

00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:27.860
I mean, how'd she get her actress involved with that fraud, Hae?

00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:29.460
Unbelievable.

00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:33.030
He just crawls out of the woodwork to sell childhood tales. Pathetic.

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:40.269
Excuse me. Who do you think you are?

00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:42.100
Who are you?

00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:43.710
Let's just go.

00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:45.009
I think he's some kind of weirdo.

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:46.580
- What's with that guy? - Let's go.

00:46:47.110 --> 00:46:48.210
Who was that?

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:08.360
You got nothing better to do?

00:47:08.361 --> 00:47:09.870
You need to watch yourself.

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:14.040
What?

00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:16.140
What are you talking about?

00:47:17.110 --> 00:47:18.770
Je Yeon told you about this already, didn't she?

00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:21.879
You don't have to take the part, so just give it a read.

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:23.050
No pressure.

00:47:25.550 --> 00:47:27.619
By "My Annoying Daughter," you don't happen to mean me, do you?

00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:29.080
It's the main role, no less.

00:47:32.090 --> 00:47:34.189
Are you slacking off on your studies again?

00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:36.430
Yes, I came here specifically to slack off.

00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:42.400
Say hi. This is Tae Rin, who I'm sure you know,

00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:44.029
and this is my son, Kim Seok Ju.

00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:46.299
Your son? How?

00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:47.440
Because I gave birth to him.

00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:50.240
Our family tie is confidential, so please keep it a secret for now.

00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:55.679
But why is the CEO's son here?

00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:58.180
I'm here to clean the building. It's my side gig.

00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:01.820
Oh, you're so corny.

00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:05.090
Have a good shoot today.

00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:07.060
How's it going with Sunwoo Hae?

00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:08.520
Everything all right?

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:10.789
Yes, it's surprisingly comfortable.

00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:11.860
It's fine.

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:13.929
It was nice seeing him again, actually.

00:48:13.930 --> 00:48:15.330
Let's not get too chummy.

00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:18.729
Let's grab a bite after you finish reading it.

00:48:18.730 --> 00:48:20.470
Okay, take care.

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:27.710
("My Annoying Daughter")

00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:35.049
Hey!

00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:36.050
Oh, you're here.

00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:44.089
Gosh, seriously...

00:48:44.090 --> 00:48:46.060
- A rainbow. - Look, a rainbow! Did you see it?

00:48:46.530 --> 00:48:47.800
Oh, a rainbow!

00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:50.970
I'm looking for Sunwoo Hae.

00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:52.500
Yes, that's me.

00:48:52.501 --> 00:48:53.640
Here you go.

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:56.170
This is from Kim Seok Joo.

00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:57.640
Kim Seok Joo?

00:48:58.340 --> 00:48:59.340
I just need a signature right here.

00:48:59.710 --> 00:49:01.340
- Thank you. - Have a good one.

00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:06.150
Gosh. Kim Seok Joo.

00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:09.619
Sending a flower basket to a flower shop...

00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:11.719
Why'd I have to find out about your debut from an article?

00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:12.819
What are we, strangers?

00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:14.919
- Your number one fan, Seok Joo. - Seok Joo, with a heart?

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:16.790
He bought flowers from another shop instead of ours?

00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:18.759
I ought to just... Seriously.

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:20.199
Oh, is that what this is about?

00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:21.200
Seok Joo?

00:49:21.201 --> 00:49:23.769
Are you and Kim Seok Joo actually brothers?

00:49:23.770 --> 00:49:25.570
- And you're blood-related too? - What?

00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:28.539
You don't know Kim Seok Joo, do you?

00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:29.599
You were in different grades.

00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:30.909
Right.

00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:31.970
I doubt I know him.

00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:34.380
You're better off not knowing him.

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:36.179
Why? You two didn't get along?

00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:37.280
And we never will.

00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:41.549
I'm going to go on in.

00:49:41.550 --> 00:49:43.350
- Okay. - Okay.

00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:46.620
Oh, here, let me get that.

00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:48.490
- I'll take it in. - Thanks.

00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:52.129
- Hey, Sung Je Yeon. - Yes?

00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:55.459
You've known Kim Seok Joo way longer than me, so how could you not know?

00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:57.900
Just because we go way back, doesn't mean we're close.

00:49:58.370 --> 00:50:00.839
For you and Kim Seok Joo to be brothers,

00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:02.200
our CEO...

00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:04.110
and your father...

00:50:04.310 --> 00:50:05.310
What?

00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:08.140
She's your CEO?

00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:11.180
That's quite a reaction.

00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:16.990
I don't have anything against her.

00:50:17.550 --> 00:50:19.020
Though I can't say the same for her.

00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:28.029
You look like you have a million questions.

00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:30.030
Suddenly, I have all these questions.

00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:32.229
But I'm holding back.

00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:33.469
You can ask.

00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:35.940
Because they have absolutely nothing to do with me.

00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:38.570
They got remarried when I was a senior in high school.

00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:41.840
I wanted to live with my sibling, so I never moved in with his family.

00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:44.650
Any more questions?

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:46.920
Still, I thought...

00:50:47.350 --> 00:50:49.790
people would be happier to see you.

00:50:52.650 --> 00:50:54.190
How bad were their reactions?

00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:55.919
How bad are we talking?

00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:57.890
Let's just say you're going to live for a very long time.

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:03.130
I knew it. We should have said, "florist and novelist."

00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:04.870
Then again,

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:07.700
the tabloids would have a field day with it.

00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:09.239
All my old drama, right?

00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:11.069
I call that buzz.

00:51:11.070 --> 00:51:13.310
If people weren't interested, they wouldn't say a thing.

00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:17.379
That means you still have pull with the public.

00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:19.950
If I thought I'd regret it, I wouldn't have jumped in.

00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:25.350
I'll take care of what I have to.

00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:27.190
So don't worry too much.

00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:44.840
It's been a long time.

00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:51.380
Shush.

00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:54.220
Hae, you're not supposed to be here.

00:51:55.050 --> 00:51:56.820
What happened? You're so skinny.

00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:58.750
Have you been eating?

00:51:58.750 --> 00:51:59.750
Are you sick?

00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:02.289
I got my draft notice.

00:52:02.290 --> 00:52:03.430
I can't put it off any longer.

00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:05.830
What do we do with Nu Ri?

00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:07.430
What?

00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:10.700
Well...

00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:15.199
Hae. Let's talk inside.

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:16.300
Come on.

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:23.449
Well...

00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:24.450
What am I going to do?

00:52:25.450 --> 00:52:26.549
So...

00:52:26.550 --> 00:52:28.080
Oh, that's right! Geon No's mom.

00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:31.749
She babysat you when you were young, so maybe she can look after Nu Ri...

00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:33.919
She's the daughter of the woman you lived with.

00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:36.059
- You abandoned me and Mom. - I didn't abandon you...

00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:37.489
Chan, is someone here?

00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:38.760
No, no one's here!

00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:42.400
Hae is here.

00:52:44.730 --> 00:52:45.870
I hope you've been well.

00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:49.270
Could you watch my little sister just while I'm in the army?

00:52:50.170 --> 00:52:51.639
She hasn't even started school yet.

00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:52.710
Your sister?

00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:55.840
But her mother died ages ago.

00:52:59.250 --> 00:53:00.620
She's not her daughter.

00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:04.090
And I don't think this is the time for pride.

00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:09.019
Chan, deal with this.

00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:11.230
Okay, I'll handle...

00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:17.630
Why did you ask to see me?

00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:21.070
I wanted to see you.

00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:22.940
To see how you've been.

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:26.940
You've been quite hard to reach.

00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:28.880
I was surprised you sent for me.

00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:31.450
I've been waiting a long time for this.

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:35.650
Longer than I have? I doubt it.

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:43.220
This is the money you gave me in high school.

00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:45.930
I put it to good use.

00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:56.040
If I were that strapped for cash, I wouldn't have paid off the debt.

00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:58.910
Don't you understand what it meant when I paid off the debt?

00:53:59.710 --> 00:54:00.910
Of course, I do.

00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:02.640
This...

00:54:03.810 --> 00:54:05.780
I wanted to clear my conscience.

00:54:07.350 --> 00:54:08.880
After all, you're the one who put up with that man.

00:54:16.460 --> 00:54:18.930
You seem to be doing quite well for yourself.

00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:21.400
No matter what you've become,

00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:24.100
to me, you're still the same 20-year-old Sunwoo Hae,

00:54:25.070 --> 00:54:26.470
a student who constantly skipped school,

00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:28.700
who's constantly in and out of motels and bars.

00:54:30.210 --> 00:54:32.240
I guess it never occurred to you to feel sorry for me.

00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:35.209
With you acting like that, how was I to find you endearing?

00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:36.710
And why shouldn't you have?

00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:39.510
As for Seok Joo going off the rails,

00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:42.350
it's much more convenient for you to blame it all on me, isn't it?

00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:45.989
Seok Joo went ahead...

00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:48.419
and brought home your sister, who could as well be your daughter.

00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:50.360
- And I even gave her a room. - That's my point.

00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:53.329
That's why I'm good to Seok Joo. To repay you for that.

00:54:53.330 --> 00:54:56.930
You were the right age to have her, weren't you?

00:54:57.570 --> 00:54:59.200
Do you get that from your mother, too?

00:54:59.900 --> 00:55:02.269
I have no idea why you suddenly felt the need to take this out on me,

00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:03.270
and I don't really care.

00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:04.970
I'm just here...

00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:08.010
to repay a debt I owe. That's all.

00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:10.080
You should go back in.

00:55:18.890 --> 00:55:20.790
Same nasty attitude as always.

00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:33.300
Welcome.

00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:38.040
Son. I started a publishing company.

00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:40.140
Here. A little something to celebrate the opening.

00:55:43.610 --> 00:55:45.280
They turned out really nice.

00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:48.850
These should probably go in the fridge...

00:55:50.290 --> 00:55:51.390
You opened it today?

00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:53.120
Three years ago today.

00:55:58.060 --> 00:55:59.160
Why are you here?

00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:02.230
I thought we were supposed to be dead to each other.

00:56:05.470 --> 00:56:06.500
Well...

00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:09.870
I saw the article.

00:56:12.310 --> 00:56:13.680
Are you really going to be on that show?

00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:16.280
I was worried.

00:56:17.350 --> 00:56:18.850
I didn't see this one coming.

00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:21.280
Of all the fallout from the article, of course, this would be part of it.

00:56:22.650 --> 00:56:24.850
If you happen to need money, I'd like to help you out...

00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:31.130
I'm just worried about you.

00:56:37.770 --> 00:56:39.499
Does that woman know you came here?

00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:40.600
I should get going.

00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:45.069
Oh, you look busy. Right, I'll get out.

00:56:45.070 --> 00:56:47.240
Just give me one rose.

00:56:48.810 --> 00:56:50.009
Just one.

00:56:50.010 --> 00:56:52.880
Usually, men only buy flowers when they've done something wrong.

00:56:53.210 --> 00:56:55.180
There are plenty of flower shops in Seoul,

00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:57.720
so go buy one somewhere else, Mr. Poet.

00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:01.960
I'll come back.

00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:16.170
A single rose? What's that all about?

00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:29.050
- Knock, knock. - Hello.

00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:31.950
I've been watching you for a while now.

00:57:32.250 --> 00:57:35.660
Are you shopping for yourself? Or for Tae Rin?

00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:37.190
Let me see.

00:57:37.490 --> 00:57:39.289
We didn't get a call from a stylist.

00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:40.500
No, it's for me.

00:57:41.330 --> 00:57:44.300
Do you have any clothes that are hard to rip?

00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:46.470
Okay.

00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:48.200
So, let me get this straight.

00:57:49.170 --> 00:57:51.970
Do you want it to rip eventually? Or...

00:57:52.510 --> 00:57:54.280
do you want something that takes a lot of effort...

00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:56.579
to rip? What's the end goal here?

00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:58.509
Something sturdy. The sturdiest you have.

00:57:58.510 --> 00:58:00.519
Something I can wear for ten years.

00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:03.349
Design, colour, durability...

00:58:03.350 --> 00:58:05.220
I don't want to compromise on a single thing.

00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:07.420
I know.

00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:09.419
Let's have a look, shall we?

00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:11.160
Let's see what my babies have to offer.

00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:16.060
Oh, my baby.

00:58:17.070 --> 00:58:18.070
Oh my.

00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:20.799
I can't believe I overlooked this.

00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:23.139
This is the number one pick for you.

00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:24.439
What do you think?

00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:25.510
I trust you.

00:58:26.910 --> 00:58:29.040
It's going to rip eventually.

00:58:30.910 --> 00:58:32.480
- It absolutely can't. - It won't.

00:58:33.450 --> 00:58:34.450
Here you go.

00:58:34.451 --> 00:58:36.349
You'll get a solid ten years out of this, easy.

00:58:36.350 --> 00:58:37.520
- I trust you. - Good.

00:58:44.830 --> 00:58:47.229
Je Yeon, we have a problem. Did you see the follow-up article?

00:58:47.230 --> 00:58:48.960
There's a video attached to it.

00:58:58.970 --> 00:59:00.710
Yes. What video are you talking about?

00:59:04.650 --> 00:59:05.650
What?

00:59:14.290 --> 00:59:15.290
Ma'am.

00:59:17.890 --> 00:59:19.929
There's a follow-up article on Tae Rin's documentary,

00:59:19.930 --> 00:59:21.030
and we have a problem.

00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:23.160
I think you'd better take a look.

00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:27.999
There's an old news clip attached to it,

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.440
and it's being used as clickbait.

00:59:30.370 --> 00:59:32.310
This isn't going to look good for Tae Rin.

00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:36.480
That poor, unlucky girl.

00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:38.949
Did you see that video of Mo Tae Rin?

00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:42.579
You know "Beat and Bebop?" The sitcom clip suddenly went viral.

00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:45.550
But of course, taking advantage of it, the vultures cover it.

00:59:46.350 --> 00:59:48.219
Unbelievable. Profiting off someone's misery...

00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:49.790
What is it?

00:59:50.890 --> 00:59:52.359
What about someone's misery? What?

00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:53.390
Gossiping?

00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:55.729
Did you see this? An article just popped up.

00:59:55.730 --> 00:59:56.730
What?

01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:36.340
This came out way too good for the mood I'm in.

01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:39.740
I should take a picture.

01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:44.310
Where did my phone go?

01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:55.790
Oh, here it is.

01:00:58.690 --> 01:01:00.160
Why'd you call so many times?

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:03.200
(Producer Jin So Ra)

01:01:05.730 --> 01:01:06.770
Yes, Producer?

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.700
Why weren't you picking up?

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:11.810
Gosh, I thought something had happened.

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:15.240
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:19.149
I was working and had my phone on silent.

01:01:19.150 --> 01:01:20.150
I'm really sorry.

01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:21.480
Is something wrong?

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:31.390
I see.

01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:36.300
Yes.

01:01:41.070 --> 01:01:42.870
Yes, I'm fine.

01:01:45.070 --> 01:01:46.210
I'm really fine.

01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:48.510
Okay.

01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:58.649
Mr. Lee, the CEO of A Entertainment and a film director,

01:01:58.650 --> 01:01:59.719
is on the run after embezzling...

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:02.119
five million dollars in production funds.

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:05.259
Meanwhile, Film Director Lee, who fled after embezzling the funds,

01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:07.359
remains at large.

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:09.029
The mother of Actor Sunwoo Hae,

01:02:09.030 --> 01:02:10.529
a victim in the A Entertainment fraud case,

01:02:10.530 --> 01:02:13.129
was found dead in her home this afternoon.

01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:15.869
A suicide note left by Sunwoo Hae's mother has been found,

01:02:15.870 --> 01:02:19.839
stating she took her life after being scammed out of millions...

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:22.209
by film director Lee, the former CEO of A Entertainment.

01:02:22.210 --> 01:02:23.780
The discovery is a heartbreaking turn in the ongoing case.

01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:27.949
Meanwhile, Film Director Lee, who fled after embezzling the funds,

01:02:27.950 --> 01:02:30.050
remains at large.

01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:33.990
Police say they are investigating Lee's family and associates.

01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:37.990
Sunwoo Hae's family reportedly lost millions of dollars.

01:02:38.290 --> 01:02:40.599
Regarding Lee's alleged fraud,

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:44.629
police also consider the possibility that Hae's family were accomplices.

01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:47.339
Sunwoo Hae, who first discovered the body,

01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:49.300
is keeping a lonely vigil at the funeral hall.

01:03:08.090 --> 01:03:11.189
Hey, what are we going to do? The baby just won't cry.

01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:14.200
Tell me about it. He has to cry for us to use the footage.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.599
Excuse me! Coming through. Hey!

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:22.539
- Get out of the way! - What?

01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:26.370
Hey! This is all because of you.

01:03:26.770 --> 01:03:28.679
- You think dying solves everything? - Hey, get this.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.140
You think it's over just because you're dead?

01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:33.580
Mu Yeong!

01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:37.949
You should've paid me back!

01:03:37.950 --> 01:03:41.360
What about my money? What am I supposed to do!

01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:52.370
Hey, I heard you've made a lot of money.

01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:55.100
You. Sign this.

01:04:00.610 --> 01:04:02.680
Say something!

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:06.610
Hurry! Sign it!

01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:08.720
What's this?

01:04:11.950 --> 01:04:14.459
Are you his father? Hey!

01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:16.819
What are you going to do about my money? Hey!

01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:19.930
Hey, old man! You know Director Lee, right?

01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:06.340
Sorry.

01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:09.380
I'm so sorry.

01:05:10.510 --> 01:05:11.710
No...

01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:14.850
I didn't know, I swear.

01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:19.320
No, I looked into everything. I did. But I must have missed something.

01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:24.290
It's my fault.

01:05:29.230 --> 01:05:30.460
I'm sorry.

01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:32.700
I'm so sorry.

01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:38.610
I'll...

01:05:39.070 --> 01:05:40.310
make everything right again.

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:45.310
Just give me a little time.

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:55.960
Don't go.

01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:03.130
Can you just...

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:08.840
hold me one more time?

01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:54.050
I guess I was hoping...

01:06:57.720 --> 01:06:59.090
that you would.
