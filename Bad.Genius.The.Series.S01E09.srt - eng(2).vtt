00:00:42.754 --> 00:00:44.881
May I have your attention, please?

00:00:44.906 --> 00:00:47.534
You have 45 minutes allotted for it.

00:00:48.535 --> 00:00:49.619
And your time...

00:00:49.651 --> 00:00:50.699
Now!

00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:56.326
Good morning!

00:00:56.351 --> 00:00:57.394
Today is a good day.

00:00:57.419 --> 00:00:58.145
Come in!

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.838
As of now, I just got the update.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.933
They just finished their first section.

00:01:02.174 --> 00:01:04.777
So, anytime soon, we're
gonna get the answers, okay?

00:01:06.686 --> 00:01:07.812
Lin already messaged.

00:01:08.185 --> 00:01:08.823
A.

00:01:08.848 --> 00:01:09.848
A.

00:01:10.182 --> 00:01:10.682
B.

00:01:10.682 --> 00:01:11.158
B.

00:01:11.183 --> 00:01:11.783
A.

00:01:11.808 --> 00:01:12.200
A.

00:01:12.225 --> 00:01:12.726
C.

00:01:12.726 --> 00:01:13.618
[Additional 500k if you want
me to send the answers.]

00:01:13.643 --> 00:01:15.090
What am I? Stupid?!

00:01:15.115 --> 00:01:17.080
I should've just had him beaten
up when he was at the shop!

00:01:17.105 --> 00:01:18.190
That son of a bitch!

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.191
He's a greedy bastard!

00:01:19.216 --> 00:01:20.216
Fuck him!

00:01:20.653 --> 00:01:22.029
Pat, just stop!

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.256
What now?

00:01:26.281 --> 00:01:27.716
We're gonna be late!

00:01:27.741 --> 00:01:28.742
Sorry, excuse us.

00:01:28.742 --> 00:01:29.576
Is there a problem?

00:01:29.576 --> 00:01:32.746
I'm sorry to disrupt your break time.

00:01:33.138 --> 00:01:37.893
However, it has come to my
attention that there was some

00:01:37.918 --> 00:01:41.755
troublesome misconduct
that you should all be aware of.

00:01:50.514 --> 00:01:51.515
So,

00:01:52.641 --> 00:01:53.809
here we are.

00:01:54.267 --> 00:01:57.521
Just you and me, Mr. Bangkat.

00:01:59.122 --> 00:02:01.875
Perhaps now, you could explain how come

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.486
there are two cellphones on the table.

00:02:05.987 --> 00:02:06.987
No?

00:02:07.264 --> 00:02:08.418
Let me help you a little.

00:02:10.122 --> 00:02:12.082
The cellphone on the right

00:02:12.402 --> 00:02:15.279
is the one that you
gave us during entrance.

00:02:16.193 --> 00:02:17.778
The cellphone on the left

00:02:17.803 --> 00:02:21.264
is the one that we found
in the men's restroom.

00:02:22.921 --> 00:02:23.921
Which

00:02:24.381 --> 00:02:26.466
you confessed to all.

00:02:27.092 --> 00:02:30.595
So, if you would now
kindly explain the situation,

00:02:30.595 --> 00:02:32.681
it would save us all a lot of time.

00:02:35.915 --> 00:02:38.084
Do you have any idea

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.773
of the risks involved
in what you're doing?

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:47.565
Mister, you're not answering
my questions once again.

00:02:48.363 --> 00:02:49.573
Just tell me one thing.

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:53.615
What were you intending
to do with this cellphone?

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.640
Just that.

00:02:58.458 --> 00:02:59.458
Perhaps,

00:02:59.504 --> 00:03:01.631
I should call your
mother in the Philippines

00:03:02.546 --> 00:03:08.176
and tell her that her son is
involved in a cheating scheme.

00:03:09.224 --> 00:03:11.101
I'll tell your mother

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.514
that her son is a cheat.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.059
How would you like that, Mr. Bangkat?

00:03:18.727 --> 00:03:20.562
Don't test my patience,

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:21.979
boy!

00:03:24.024 --> 00:03:26.860
I could call now the Philippine government

00:03:27.123 --> 00:03:28.833
How about that?

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.088
And tell them all about this.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.583
That would have nasty
consequences for you.

00:03:35.047 --> 00:03:35.969
Or,

00:03:35.994 --> 00:03:38.538
we could be a little more benevolent.

00:03:38.955 --> 00:03:42.167
If you just gave me the
names of your accomplices

00:03:42.167 --> 00:03:43.200
in this scheme,

00:03:43.793 --> 00:03:47.005
how about that, Mr. Bangkat?

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.310
Ms. Linette Estrella, is it?

00:05:25.166 --> 00:05:26.334
Did I get that right?

00:05:27.188 --> 00:05:27.981
Never mind.

00:05:27.981 --> 00:05:28.981
Yeah?

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:32.027
Now, it's you and me here, alone.

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:33.839
Perhaps,

00:05:34.785 --> 00:05:36.370
you could speak freely now.

00:05:37.594 --> 00:05:38.720
Will you cooperate?

00:05:43.163 --> 00:05:44.289
Yes, I'll try.

00:05:44.471 --> 00:05:45.477
You'll try?

00:05:45.748 --> 00:05:48.042
Well, that's all we can ask, right?

00:05:49.002 --> 00:05:51.755
You did not come here alone, did you?

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:56.301
There's that other
participant, Tristan Bangkat,

00:05:57.015 --> 00:05:58.308
from the Philippines.

00:05:58.739 --> 00:05:59.836
You know him, right?

00:06:02.515 --> 00:06:03.515
I don't.

00:06:04.142 --> 00:06:05.076
I don't know that.

00:06:05.101 --> 00:06:06.436
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:06:07.457 --> 00:06:08.547
I don't know him.

00:06:08.855 --> 00:06:09.977
You don't know him.

00:06:10.844 --> 00:06:12.242
Now, that's funny.

00:06:13.068 --> 00:06:16.738
Because your papers indicate
you're both from the same school,

00:06:17.353 --> 00:06:19.305
Colegio St. Gabriel,

00:06:19.631 --> 00:06:20.631
Possenti?

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.120
What if I called the principal over there?

00:06:24.435 --> 00:06:27.188
What would they say about
what's happening here?

00:06:32.504 --> 00:06:35.507
Yes, we go to the same
school, but he's not my friend.

00:06:36.224 --> 00:06:37.224
Hmm.

00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:38.581
There you go.

00:06:39.083 --> 00:06:42.503
There’s an STIC
center in the Philippines.

00:06:42.907 --> 00:06:44.699
You could have taken the exam there.

00:06:44.724 --> 00:06:46.476
You still chose to take it over here.

00:06:47.393 --> 00:06:48.393
How come?

00:06:49.104 --> 00:06:50.313
My mom lives here.

00:06:51.523 --> 00:06:52.290
Your mom?

00:06:52.315 --> 00:06:52.999
Ye—

00:06:53.024 --> 00:06:54.442
Yes, I came to visit her.

00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:56.251
Your mom lives here.

00:06:57.112 --> 00:06:58.133
Right.

00:07:00.532 --> 00:07:01.532
Prove it.

00:07:06.579 --> 00:07:07.579
Call her.

00:07:52.375 --> 00:07:55.545
Ms. Wynona Robinson.

00:07:55.962 --> 00:07:57.297
From Bathurst, is it?

00:07:58.006 --> 00:08:01.217
Well, we do have a center
to take exams near Bathurst.

00:08:02.348 --> 00:08:05.518
Why do you think your daughter
chose this center to take it?

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:09.204
It's my daughter's first time in Sydney.

00:08:09.229 --> 00:08:10.976
She wanted to stay in the city center.

00:08:13.938 --> 00:08:14.938
I see.

00:08:16.149 --> 00:08:18.026
Still, we have an issue here.

00:08:18.698 --> 00:08:20.951
I do believe that your
daughter was cheating.

00:08:21.863 --> 00:08:22.864
That's impossible.

00:08:23.114 --> 00:08:25.742
Lin is the top student in her class.

00:08:26.162 --> 00:08:27.830
She won't have any reason to cheat.

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:31.427
Well, smart kids
follow rules, don't they?

00:08:32.457 --> 00:08:33.460
Smart kids

00:08:33.882 --> 00:08:36.718
don't run and hide when they're caught.

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:38.420
Yet,

00:08:38.992 --> 00:08:44.831
Lin ran and locked
herself up in the bathroom.

00:08:46.179 --> 00:08:47.472
My apologies.

00:08:48.181 --> 00:08:50.433
She's always been a nervous child.

00:08:52.268 --> 00:08:53.268
But,

00:08:53.443 --> 00:08:55.062
was that her only offense?

00:08:55.625 --> 00:08:56.626
I'm afraid so.

00:08:57.891 --> 00:08:59.559
Then why are you still detaining her?

00:09:00.842 --> 00:09:01.842
Fair enough.

00:09:02.935 --> 00:09:05.429
No need to escalate the matter nor

00:09:06.037 --> 00:09:07.622
alert the authorities.

00:09:08.763 --> 00:09:09.763
Still,

00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:11.511
she did break the rules.

00:09:12.914 --> 00:09:14.541
She left the exam room

00:09:14.856 --> 00:09:17.108
before it was time and without permission.

00:09:17.133 --> 00:09:18.133
Therefore,

00:09:18.766 --> 00:09:20.393
we need to disqualify her.

00:09:26.094 --> 00:09:27.220
We understand.

00:09:28.888 --> 00:09:29.889
Very well, then.

00:09:52.117 --> 00:09:53.744
I have no excuse, Mom.

00:09:55.456 --> 00:09:57.417
I lied to you and Dad.

00:09:58.882 --> 00:10:00.342
I'm so sorry, Mom.

00:10:01.548 --> 00:10:05.135
And I'm ready to accept whatever
consequences that seem fit.

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:08.136
I'll accept it.

00:10:08.334 --> 00:10:09.919
I don't wanna punish you, Lin.

00:10:10.953 --> 00:10:13.080
I just wanna know why you did this.

00:10:14.684 --> 00:10:17.395
And why didn’t you tell
me you were coming here?

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.177
Lin, what's happening to you?

00:10:22.275 --> 00:10:23.276
You can talk to me.

00:10:29.115 --> 00:10:30.116
Who am I kidding?

00:10:31.367 --> 00:10:33.536
You don't even talk to
your dad, let alone me.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:40.335
But I'm still your mom.

00:10:41.836 --> 00:10:44.130
I can't help but be bothered
by what’s happening to you.

00:10:45.757 --> 00:10:47.717
And no matter what you’ve done,

00:10:48.325 --> 00:10:50.160
I'm always on your side, Lin.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.328
Always on my side?

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:00.021
How are you on my side
when you're so far away, Mom?

00:11:06.027 --> 00:11:07.028
I'm sorry.

00:11:08.863 --> 00:11:09.864
I'm sorry.

00:11:16.579 --> 00:11:17.622
Don't be sorry.

00:11:18.956 --> 00:11:20.333
I guess I deserve it.

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:25.421
I'm also to blame for why
things turned out this way.

00:11:27.256 --> 00:11:29.133
I'm the only one at fault here, Mom.

00:11:29.425 --> 00:11:30.760
You don't have to take my side.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.678
You have no involvement in this.

00:11:33.429 --> 00:11:34.429
It's all me.

00:11:36.099 --> 00:11:38.261
And I'm sorry that I disappointed you.

00:11:40.061 --> 00:11:41.938
It shouldn’t have gotten this far.

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:48.860
Lin,

00:11:49.704 --> 00:11:50.704
please.

00:11:52.245 --> 00:11:54.122
Don't treat me like a stranger.

00:11:56.577 --> 00:11:59.372
I waited so long for us
to see each other again.

00:12:06.337 --> 00:12:07.839
It’s so hard because,

00:12:10.967 --> 00:12:12.510
all this time, you thought...

00:12:13.845 --> 00:12:16.639
it was easy for me to
leave you all behind.

00:12:18.141 --> 00:12:20.643
It’s not that easy to
leave the ones you love.

00:12:22.186 --> 00:12:24.272
But sometimes,
I really have no choice...

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.124
you want to help them but...

00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:32.960
they also need to help themselves.

00:12:39.871 --> 00:12:42.081
You won't understand that
because you're still young.

00:12:45.376 --> 00:12:47.336
I understand that feeling.

00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:49.233
That...

00:12:49.672 --> 00:12:52.675
helpless feeling when you can’t help
the people who are important to you.

00:12:55.011 --> 00:12:57.180
But we always have a choice.

00:13:00.728 --> 00:13:01.746
You're right.

00:13:03.311 --> 00:13:04.896
And your dad had a choice.

00:13:06.722 --> 00:13:09.600
He could've followed me here,

00:13:11.152 --> 00:13:12.152
and then,

00:13:12.695 --> 00:13:14.113
we could’ve lived here.

00:13:14.614 --> 00:13:16.157
Lin, I was earning more.

00:13:16.157 --> 00:13:17.575
I had a good job here.

00:13:17.825 --> 00:13:19.118
But he refused.

00:13:19.827 --> 00:13:21.871
He didn't even give it a chance.

00:13:22.914 --> 00:13:24.123
All I know is,

00:13:25.166 --> 00:13:26.709
Dad was waiting for you.

00:13:28.336 --> 00:13:30.087
But you married someone else.

00:13:31.839 --> 00:13:33.216
He was hurt, Mom.

00:13:36.802 --> 00:13:38.346
That’s where I went wrong.

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.599
I let myself fall in love.

00:13:42.892 --> 00:13:44.852
I cheated on your Dad.

00:13:48.356 --> 00:13:49.607
You know,

00:13:51.317 --> 00:13:53.861
Vin and I were together
when we were young.

00:13:55.905 --> 00:13:57.490
Even if I loved him so much,

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:01.494
I didn’t really know myself back then.

00:14:03.037 --> 00:14:05.206
We weren’t meant for each other.

00:14:08.626 --> 00:14:09.752
But with Greg,

00:14:11.212 --> 00:14:12.463
It was different.

00:14:13.798 --> 00:14:15.591
He’s easy to love.

00:14:16.008 --> 00:14:18.010
We understand each other.

00:14:20.471 --> 00:14:22.223
But I never regretted being with Vin.

00:14:25.476 --> 00:14:27.645
Because— We had you.

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:32.066
Lin, whatever happened
between me and your Dad,

00:14:33.109 --> 00:14:35.611
it has nothing to do
with my love for you.

00:14:41.617 --> 00:14:42.617
I know it's

00:14:43.744 --> 00:14:46.747
a little too late for us to be close.

00:14:49.901 --> 00:14:51.945
I just hope you can forgive me.

00:14:53.879 --> 00:14:55.423
I forgave you, Mom.

00:14:57.408 --> 00:14:58.408
A long time ago.

00:15:01.092 --> 00:15:03.220
It’s over, I’ve moved on.

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:05.745
We’re okay now.

00:15:08.394 --> 00:15:09.854
But maybe,

00:15:11.063 --> 00:15:12.064
sometimes,

00:15:14.483 --> 00:15:15.985
I miss you too.

00:15:18.659 --> 00:15:20.118
Actually, no, Mom.

00:15:20.419 --> 00:15:22.171
I miss you always.

00:15:23.784 --> 00:15:27.997
I miss the feeling of having
a mom with me at home.

00:15:29.063 --> 00:15:31.050
Someone I can just joke around with.

00:15:32.154 --> 00:15:33.823
Someone I can talk to.

00:15:33.848 --> 00:15:36.058
Someone I can hug.

00:15:38.137 --> 00:15:39.681
I missed that, Mom.

00:15:43.012 --> 00:15:44.764
I’m sorry for everything, Lin.

00:15:44.988 --> 00:15:45.988
Sorry.

00:15:47.339 --> 00:15:49.174
I love you so much.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.062
I love you too, Mom.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:53.397
I’m so sorry, Mom.

00:15:58.540 --> 00:15:59.958
I’m so sorry, Mom.

00:16:33.633 --> 00:16:34.675
Is this them?

00:16:35.791 --> 00:16:37.376
Your new family?

00:16:46.585 --> 00:16:47.585
See that?

00:16:48.916 --> 00:16:49.916
That’s you.

00:16:50.469 --> 00:16:52.263
You’re part of the family.

00:16:55.929 --> 00:16:57.973
You know, Carson...

00:16:57.998 --> 00:16:59.500
when we talk...

00:17:01.645 --> 00:17:03.021
he always thinks you’re just a baby

00:17:03.046 --> 00:17:05.402
because that’s what
you look like in the picture.

00:17:05.427 --> 00:17:07.846
That’s why he calls you baby sister.

00:17:10.931 --> 00:17:13.621
I'm glad he already knows me.

00:17:15.901 --> 00:17:18.195
Even if it’s just through
your stories or your photo.

00:17:27.025 --> 00:17:28.025
But Mom.

00:17:29.493 --> 00:17:31.746
Thanks for saving me earlier.

00:17:33.164 --> 00:17:34.164
Sorry.

00:17:39.182 --> 00:17:42.018
Greg and I already talked
actually, last week

00:17:42.043 --> 00:17:43.670
after we spoke on the phone.

00:17:45.215 --> 00:17:47.425
You can live with us if you’ll study here.

00:17:50.055 --> 00:17:52.725
And you won’t need that STIC anymore

00:17:52.725 --> 00:17:54.143
because you’ll already be a resident,

00:17:54.143 --> 00:17:55.144
if you’ll live here.

00:17:56.661 --> 00:17:57.661
Or

00:17:59.356 --> 00:18:01.066
you don’t even have to

00:18:01.091 --> 00:18:03.718
wait for your suspension to be lifted.

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:05.390
Or,

00:18:05.535 --> 00:18:07.453
you can wait ‘til you’re 18

00:18:07.507 --> 00:18:09.910
so you’re no longer
under your father’s custody.

00:18:10.159 --> 00:18:11.410
You won’t be a minor,

00:18:12.098 --> 00:18:13.599
and you can decide on your own.

00:18:18.688 --> 00:18:19.688
Thank you, Mom.

00:18:20.925 --> 00:18:22.218
That means a lot.

00:18:24.256 --> 00:18:25.256
But,

00:18:26.915 --> 00:18:28.375
Lin, I’m not rushing you.

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:30.653
Think everything through first.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:31.728
Okay?

00:18:31.753 --> 00:18:33.046
But talk to your Dad.

00:18:34.688 --> 00:18:37.065
Whatever it is you decide.

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:38.091
I’ll support you.

00:18:38.771 --> 00:18:42.024
Just know you have
the option to study here,

00:18:42.295 --> 00:18:43.605
even without a scholarship.

00:18:44.407 --> 00:18:45.407
Alright?

00:18:48.372 --> 00:18:49.748
Thank you for being here.

00:18:50.066 --> 00:18:51.066
Sorry.

00:18:56.205 --> 00:18:59.605
You see, it's all about
hard work and honesty.

00:19:00.091 --> 00:19:03.761
If you put in the hours,
you will reap the rewards.

00:19:03.786 --> 00:19:06.247
And that's why we're
giving back to the community

00:19:06.506 --> 00:19:09.318
full scholarships for
underprivileged youth.

00:19:09.343 --> 00:19:12.488
Now, that is a legacy I
would love to leave behind.

00:19:12.513 --> 00:19:14.307
Oh, speaking of legacy, sir,

00:19:15.189 --> 00:19:16.441
Your only son, Patrick,

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:19.815
is he ready to be a part
of the Tioseco Empire?

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:21.853
He's got big shoes to fill.

00:19:22.368 --> 00:19:24.037
Well, Patrick will learn.

00:19:24.062 --> 00:19:25.814
And he's learning everything fast.

00:19:25.885 --> 00:19:28.555
In fact, he's already made
plans of his own, right, son?

00:19:29.446 --> 00:19:30.446
Uh, yeah.

00:19:30.823 --> 00:19:32.488
I'm going to study business in Boston.

00:19:33.409 --> 00:19:35.119
My dad's a BU graduate, so

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:37.564
I guess I'm following his footsteps.

00:19:38.622 --> 00:19:42.418
Your father tells me that you
almost got a perfect score at the STIC.

00:19:42.882 --> 00:19:46.052
So do you have any advice
to inspire other students?

00:19:46.425 --> 00:19:48.105
I guess you just gotta put in the work

00:19:48.413 --> 00:19:50.665
and do whatever it
takes to make it to the top.

00:19:52.386 --> 00:19:54.263
You must be very proud of Pat...

00:19:54.263 --> 00:19:55.447
Oh, yeah.

00:19:55.472 --> 00:19:56.891
I'm very, very proud of him.

00:20:22.697 --> 00:20:24.207
Yo, what happened in Sydney?

00:20:24.752 --> 00:20:26.253
I heard shit went down, bro.

00:20:28.213 --> 00:20:29.715
I got caught but I didn’t get jailed.

00:20:32.009 --> 00:20:33.009
Damn.

00:20:34.887 --> 00:20:36.055
Well, tell me more.

00:20:38.189 --> 00:20:39.777
We have nothing left to talk about.

00:20:42.645 --> 00:20:43.645
Bet.

00:20:44.469 --> 00:20:45.554
That's 500k.

00:20:48.502 --> 00:20:49.502
We’re even now.

00:20:54.073 --> 00:20:55.073
We’re even now.

00:21:08.712 --> 00:21:10.589
The STIC results are in.

00:21:11.632 --> 00:21:13.801
Yup, she's in the top percentile.

00:21:14.802 --> 00:21:15.945
Ah, of course.

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:17.221
This is our Grace.

00:21:18.555 --> 00:21:19.310
Thank you.

00:21:19.335 --> 00:21:20.169
Thank you so much.

00:21:20.194 --> 00:21:21.946
Hey, see you all December, alright?

00:21:23.519 --> 00:21:24.687
Okay, bye-bye, auntie.

00:21:25.456 --> 00:21:26.172
Thank you again.

00:21:26.197 --> 00:21:27.197
Bye.

00:21:29.322 --> 00:21:30.740
Ah, Grace.

00:21:31.672 --> 00:21:33.341
We're very proud of you.

00:21:33.366 --> 00:21:34.367
All of us.

00:21:35.161 --> 00:21:36.255
Good job, dear.

00:21:36.573 --> 00:21:37.616
Okay, keep it up.

00:21:38.244 --> 00:21:39.270
Thanks, Dad.

00:21:40.411 --> 00:21:41.578
It was nothing.

00:21:42.021 --> 00:21:43.021
Really.

00:21:51.296 --> 00:21:52.881
Um, Dad?

00:21:52.918 --> 00:21:53.918
Yup?

00:21:55.876 --> 00:21:57.294
Pat and I have been thinking.

00:22:00.848 --> 00:22:01.848
Okay.

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:03.620
So,

00:22:03.699 --> 00:22:06.239
he's studying in Boston University, and

00:22:06.485 --> 00:22:08.779
I was wondering if

00:22:10.065 --> 00:22:11.734
I could study there too?

00:22:12.174 --> 00:22:14.843
I heard that they have a
really good drama program.

00:22:15.179 --> 00:22:16.179
Wait a minute.

00:22:17.153 --> 00:22:18.238
Whose idea is this?

00:22:20.649 --> 00:22:22.943
Grace, that's a very major commitment.

00:22:25.055 --> 00:22:25.931
You're still a baby.

00:22:25.956 --> 00:22:27.583
Even Pat's a baby.

00:22:27.942 --> 00:22:28.942
Alright?

00:22:30.674 --> 00:22:32.092
You're both too young.

00:22:32.117 --> 00:22:34.911
Are you really ready for this?

00:22:35.264 --> 00:22:36.264
Dad,

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.757
Pat and I want to do this together.

00:22:39.428 --> 00:22:40.428
And

00:22:40.429 --> 00:22:41.847
it's in the U.S., and I grew up there.

00:22:41.847 --> 00:22:43.583
So, this feels like a homecoming for me.

00:22:43.833 --> 00:22:44.825
You know? And,

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:46.310
even though Mom's gone,

00:22:46.852 --> 00:22:49.313
I won't be alone because Pat's there.

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:50.980
Grace,

00:22:51.771 --> 00:22:52.771
you know,

00:22:54.115 --> 00:22:55.130
your mom and I,

00:22:56.132 --> 00:22:57.550
we were like just you guys.

00:22:58.864 --> 00:23:03.147
We thought anything the world
can throw at us, we could handle.

00:23:05.149 --> 00:23:06.734
But when we went there,

00:23:09.567 --> 00:23:11.110
life wasn’t that easy.

00:23:13.681 --> 00:23:15.391
We're two different persons.

00:23:16.222 --> 00:23:17.222
And eventually,

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:20.378
we separated.

00:23:27.661 --> 00:23:28.380
Okay?

00:23:28.405 --> 00:23:29.302
Yeah.

00:23:30.562 --> 00:23:31.562
I understand.

00:23:32.145 --> 00:23:33.145
Thanks.

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:36.555
I'm just saying,

00:23:38.309 --> 00:23:39.310
don't rush it.

00:23:41.021 --> 00:23:42.107
Don't rush

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:44.746
until you’re both ready.

00:23:58.794 --> 00:23:59.359
Lin.

00:23:59.384 --> 00:24:00.384
Ah, Dad!

00:24:00.712 --> 00:24:01.739
You're still awake?

00:24:02.106 --> 00:24:03.816
I just brought up your laundry.

00:24:05.464 --> 00:24:06.549
Thank you, Dad.

00:24:07.683 --> 00:24:10.185
Ah, also a gift.

00:24:11.645 --> 00:24:12.938
From Mom.

00:24:19.069 --> 00:24:20.863
Hey, thanks.

00:24:21.989 --> 00:24:24.324
I spoke with Nona, she said

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.702
you already have plans.

00:24:28.579 --> 00:24:31.373
You're going to Australia,
and you'll study there.

00:24:34.793 --> 00:24:35.919
That’s fine.

00:24:37.796 --> 00:24:40.465
You need to think of your future.

00:24:43.468 --> 00:24:45.429
It’s just that, for me, I wish...

00:24:46.763 --> 00:24:47.973
I wish you had told me.

00:24:47.973 --> 00:24:51.393
I just don't like the feeling that
something’s being kept from me.

00:24:54.646 --> 00:24:57.816
I don’t want to make decisions
without talking to you, Dad.

00:24:59.313 --> 00:25:00.313
But,

00:25:00.652 --> 00:25:02.321
I've thought this through.

00:25:04.114 --> 00:25:06.200
I might not get another scholarship.

00:25:07.201 --> 00:25:09.620
This might be my only
chance to study abroad.

00:25:09.828 --> 00:25:10.829
I know that.

00:25:11.622 --> 00:25:13.081
I understand.

00:25:14.708 --> 00:25:15.876
We can’t avoid this.

00:25:18.514 --> 00:25:21.017
You’ll do it, and you need it, and,

00:25:21.423 --> 00:25:23.425
I just need this for myself.

00:25:25.469 --> 00:25:28.388
So don’t mind my drama.

00:25:28.735 --> 00:25:29.752
This isn’t real.

00:25:31.391 --> 00:25:33.185
I’m not leaving yet.

00:25:33.563 --> 00:25:35.273
Even if it’s my dream to study abroad,

00:25:36.855 --> 00:25:39.191
it’s so hard for me to leave you here.

00:25:41.443 --> 00:25:42.486
Don’t make me cry.

00:25:43.237 --> 00:25:44.321
Of course I’m hard to leave.

00:25:44.321 --> 00:25:45.260
This handsome face?

00:25:45.593 --> 00:25:46.635
You’ll miss this.

00:25:47.449 --> 00:25:48.158
Okay.

00:25:48.158 --> 00:25:49.201
Oh, you win!

00:25:49.201 --> 00:25:51.036
Yeah, but let’s not talk about it anymore.

00:25:51.036 --> 00:25:52.554
Go rest now, that’s enough.

00:25:52.579 --> 00:25:53.597
Go on.

00:25:53.622 --> 00:25:54.765
Go on.

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:56.458
Good night, Dad. I love you.

00:25:56.458 --> 00:25:57.334
Love you, Lin-Lin.

00:25:57.334 --> 00:25:58.213
Good night.

00:25:58.238 --> 00:25:59.948
Hope you share the gift too!

00:25:59.973 --> 00:26:01.063
I’m heading out.

00:26:01.088 --> 00:26:02.105
The handsome guy’s leaving.

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:02.923
Bye-bye.

00:26:02.923 --> 00:26:04.091
Bye, Dad. Good night.

00:26:11.807 --> 00:26:15.102
[Come get your share, sis. We miss you!]

00:26:20.355 --> 00:26:23.996
[I can’t take the money
anymore. Sorry, I’m out.]

00:26:29.988 --> 00:26:31.865
Students, attention please.

00:26:33.161 --> 00:26:34.329
As you know,

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.582
the National College Entrance Test

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:40.210
is upon us.

00:26:41.677 --> 00:26:43.944
Every Filipino student

00:26:44.921 --> 00:26:47.924
on their senior year is expected

00:26:48.341 --> 00:26:50.218
to take the NCET.

00:26:50.684 --> 00:26:53.437
The NCET test results will determine

00:26:53.462 --> 00:26:55.714
which university you get into.

00:26:56.697 --> 00:26:57.949
The higher the score,

00:26:58.415 --> 00:27:01.335
the more likely the acceptance letter.

00:27:01.622 --> 00:27:03.582
So, I highly suggest

00:27:04.031 --> 00:27:05.265
that you study

00:27:06.004 --> 00:27:09.465
like your life depends on it.

00:27:16.121 --> 00:27:16.872
Good afternoon.

00:27:16.872 --> 00:27:17.664
Oh, no need.

00:27:17.664 --> 00:27:19.666
Please remain seated, Mrs. Bangkat.

00:27:19.691 --> 00:27:21.401
- Oh, thank you.
- I hope I did not keep you waiting.

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:22.585
Tristan.

00:27:23.045 --> 00:27:24.647
It’s no problem.

00:27:24.671 --> 00:27:26.965
We were just looking over the NCET.

00:27:27.186 --> 00:27:28.437
I came across this.

00:27:28.784 --> 00:27:29.994
They returned it.

00:27:30.323 --> 00:27:31.028
Oh my.

00:27:31.053 --> 00:27:31.636
Tristan,

00:27:31.636 --> 00:27:34.264
you need to prepare for this exam.

00:27:35.953 --> 00:27:38.372
Mrs. Bangkat, didn’t Tristan tell you

00:27:38.397 --> 00:27:40.607
why I asked you to come here?

00:27:41.852 --> 00:27:42.913
Tristan,

00:27:43.023 --> 00:27:44.296
did you not tell your mom?

00:27:48.385 --> 00:27:51.846
Mrs. Bangkat, I don't
know how else to say this.

00:27:52.824 --> 00:27:54.468
So, I'll go straight to the point.

00:27:54.493 --> 00:27:56.249
I'm very disappointed, Tristan,

00:27:56.356 --> 00:27:57.691
for your mother to find out

00:27:57.716 --> 00:27:59.426
this way and that
you've been lying to her.

00:28:02.417 --> 00:28:03.518
Bank, why?

00:28:03.543 --> 00:28:04.711
What did you do?

00:28:04.711 --> 00:28:05.718
What happened?

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:15.806
Our school was contacted by the STIC,

00:28:16.556 --> 00:28:18.600
Testing Center in Sydney, Australia.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.352
Tristan went there.

00:28:21.686 --> 00:28:24.189
Basically, he was caught cheating.

00:28:24.648 --> 00:28:25.816
He took the exam

00:28:26.108 --> 00:28:28.110
but he snuck in a cellphone

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:30.404
into the restroom to use the calculator

00:28:31.279 --> 00:28:32.614
to answer the said exam.

00:28:33.824 --> 00:28:35.367
Your son admitted this.

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:37.786
Australia?

00:28:38.829 --> 00:28:40.288
How could that happen?

00:28:40.313 --> 00:28:43.097
We already spent all our
money on hospital bills.

00:28:43.667 --> 00:28:47.629
I couldn’t afford to send my son abroad.

00:28:47.654 --> 00:28:50.324
This came straight from the STIC office.

00:28:52.644 --> 00:28:54.550
I'm sorry to disappoint you, ma'am, but

00:28:55.483 --> 00:28:56.525
this is the proof.

00:29:01.007 --> 00:29:02.717
Just a moment, ma'am.

00:29:04.875 --> 00:29:06.502
I know my son.

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:10.331
Even with the hardest
math problems you give him,

00:29:10.615 --> 00:29:13.534
he can calculate them in his head.

00:29:14.072 --> 00:29:16.366
Why would he use a calculator?

00:29:16.366 --> 00:29:17.371
I know, ma'am,

00:29:17.862 --> 00:29:21.616
I'm also wondering why
he would need a calculator,

00:29:23.181 --> 00:29:28.144
why he would sneak in a
cellphone into the bathroom.

00:29:36.315 --> 00:29:39.610
Ah, we arrived with the STIC officials

00:29:39.812 --> 00:29:41.688
with a mutual decision.

00:29:42.154 --> 00:29:43.989
to take this matter privately.

00:29:44.548 --> 00:29:48.802
But, Colegio de San Gabriel
Possenti does not condone cheating

00:29:49.858 --> 00:29:51.026
in any form.

00:29:51.641 --> 00:29:55.561
Ma'am, we aren’t even
sure yet that this is cheating.

00:29:56.406 --> 00:29:57.908
I know my son.

00:29:58.158 --> 00:29:59.784
He’s not a cheater.

00:30:00.744 --> 00:30:01.629
- Mom.
- Please.

00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:02.777
No, wait.

00:30:02.834 --> 00:30:03.863
Don’t.

00:30:04.206 --> 00:30:05.499
Let me handle this.

00:30:06.194 --> 00:30:07.058
You know,

00:30:07.083 --> 00:30:10.086
this has never happened
in the history of our school

00:30:10.504 --> 00:30:11.546
of Possenti.

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:12.880
Tristan.

00:30:13.548 --> 00:30:15.133
Never in the history

00:30:15.456 --> 00:30:17.792
of our school has this ever happened.

00:30:19.429 --> 00:30:20.639
Will I be suspended, ma'am?

00:30:20.639 --> 00:30:21.781
Suspended?

00:30:21.806 --> 00:30:22.699
No.

00:30:22.724 --> 00:30:24.559
Ma'am, just a moment.

00:30:24.823 --> 00:30:26.566
I’m begging you.

00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:29.410
If my son has done something wrong,

00:30:29.618 --> 00:30:31.162
I’ll talk to him.

00:30:31.691 --> 00:30:34.277
But can we please discuss this first

00:30:34.277 --> 00:30:36.655
before you make a decision?

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.807
Ma'am, my hands are
really tied up. Sorry.

00:30:39.545 --> 00:30:42.256
If I donated a new computer

00:30:42.634 --> 00:30:45.178
or sponsored a new building,

00:30:45.862 --> 00:30:48.669
would you still talk to us this way?

00:30:48.694 --> 00:30:50.738
If I had millions,

00:30:51.002 --> 00:30:53.527
would you treat my son like this?

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:55.715
- I beg your pardon?
- Ma'am.

00:30:56.005 --> 00:30:57.673
We’re not wealthy.

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:02.714
The only thing I can pass down to my son

00:31:02.847 --> 00:31:05.267
is a good education.

00:31:08.864 --> 00:31:10.616
Please give us

00:31:11.929 --> 00:31:13.848
a fair chance.

00:31:16.236 --> 00:31:20.198
Whatever it is that my son did, I’m sure

00:31:20.539 --> 00:31:23.041
he had a good reason.

00:31:26.559 --> 00:31:29.062
My son is a good student.

00:31:32.166 --> 00:31:34.752
He’s not a cheater.

00:31:35.259 --> 00:31:36.371
Mom, that’s enough.

00:31:36.537 --> 00:31:37.537
Bank!

00:31:38.153 --> 00:31:40.405
Son, fight for yourself.

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:42.266
Explain.

00:31:42.554 --> 00:31:44.347
Speak up.

00:32:11.333 --> 00:32:12.917
Nice glow up.

00:32:14.502 --> 00:32:15.527
Thanks, Lin.

00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:17.610
But there’s still a lot that needs fixing.

00:32:18.212 --> 00:32:20.574
That’s still going to be added
with two more washing machines.

00:32:21.092 --> 00:32:22.844
At least, we’re slowly recovering.

00:32:23.692 --> 00:32:24.692
You,

00:32:25.347 --> 00:32:26.347
how are you?

00:32:26.712 --> 00:32:27.616
Well,

00:32:27.641 --> 00:32:29.476
I have a new part-time job.

00:32:29.762 --> 00:32:30.863
Music lessons.

00:32:31.381 --> 00:32:32.257
Just home-based.

00:32:32.282 --> 00:32:33.325
Just saving a bit.

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:36.207
Saving?

00:32:36.232 --> 00:32:36.983
What happened to the—

00:32:36.983 --> 00:32:38.360
I didn’t take the money.

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:44.630
I felt

00:32:45.825 --> 00:32:47.369
guilty about it.

00:32:48.737 --> 00:32:50.864
Especially after everything
you went through.

00:32:52.165 --> 00:32:55.085
Mr. Clark said your
scores were disqualified.

00:32:57.229 --> 00:32:58.229
And

00:32:58.254 --> 00:33:00.423
we didn’t talk anymore after that.

00:33:02.556 --> 00:33:04.349
I don’t want to talk about it anymore.

00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:07.000
People have moved on.

00:33:07.112 --> 00:33:08.321
And I’m fine now.

00:33:09.265 --> 00:33:11.059
The million was worth it anyway.

00:33:12.394 --> 00:33:14.229
And I could never be as good as you.

00:33:15.438 --> 00:33:18.316
Conscience can't buy this renovation.

00:33:19.734 --> 00:33:20.902
Bank, come on.

00:33:22.237 --> 00:33:25.031
I didn’t come here to fight with you.

00:33:25.532 --> 00:33:27.367
We’re in different situations.

00:33:28.618 --> 00:33:29.869
Just kidding, Lin.

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:31.913
You’re too serious.

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:33.858
Alright, fine.

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:36.253
But serious mode for real.

00:33:37.711 --> 00:33:39.838
Actually, I’m here to say goodbye.

00:33:40.422 --> 00:33:41.436
Goodbye?

00:33:42.215 --> 00:33:43.537
Why? Where are you going?

00:33:44.342 --> 00:33:45.342
Australia.

00:33:46.569 --> 00:33:48.863
I’m going to study there with Mom.

00:33:54.561 --> 00:33:55.561
Wow.

00:33:57.159 --> 00:33:58.398
That’s great, Lin.

00:33:59.649 --> 00:34:00.649
Congrats.

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:03.545
I’m happy for you.

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:05.739
You’ve been manifesting
that for a while, right?

00:34:07.574 --> 00:34:08.605
You deserve it.

00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:09.950
You’re really lucky.

00:34:10.418 --> 00:34:11.418
Thanks, Bank.

00:34:12.234 --> 00:34:13.277
I’ll miss you.

00:34:22.378 --> 00:34:24.254
But congratulations, okay?

00:34:25.592 --> 00:34:26.592
Thanks.

00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:30.388
Nice glow up.

00:34:33.057 --> 00:34:34.184
Really beautiful.

00:34:43.812 --> 00:34:44.669
Patrick,

00:34:44.694 --> 00:34:47.363
it's rude to be on your
phone while we’re eating.

00:34:47.363 --> 00:34:48.782
Just finish your food.

00:34:50.754 --> 00:34:51.754
Sorry, Dad.

00:34:52.425 --> 00:34:53.995
Breaking news.

00:34:54.156 --> 00:34:56.950
Massive cheating in the Standardized Test

00:34:56.975 --> 00:34:59.686
for Intellectual Capacity
is under investigation.

00:35:00.967 --> 00:35:01.967
Wait.

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.403
Put that back on.

00:35:03.428 --> 00:35:04.503
I wanna hear the rest of that.

00:35:05.215 --> 00:35:06.215
Come on.

00:35:12.766 --> 00:35:16.770
This bombshell came from a
mysterious dummy account.

00:35:17.398 --> 00:35:21.110
They said the answers were hidden
in barcodes attached to the pencils.

00:35:24.901 --> 00:35:26.111
What a bunch of idiots.

00:35:27.893 --> 00:35:30.354
How hard is it to just study?

00:35:31.885 --> 00:35:33.845
All money, no brains.

00:35:38.615 --> 00:35:39.615
Yeah, Dad.

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:41.750
It’s a hassle.

00:35:42.655 --> 00:35:44.157
Well, you have no choice.

00:35:44.508 --> 00:35:47.762
You need to reapply for the
next round of examinations.

00:35:48.842 --> 00:35:51.302
The deadline for Boston
University is still far away.

00:35:51.302 --> 00:35:52.971
You can still make it.

00:35:56.891 --> 00:35:57.892
Yes, Uncle.

00:36:03.243 --> 00:36:06.413
The STIC officials were left cluless

00:36:06.438 --> 00:36:08.565
that cheating happened in the exam room.

00:36:09.362 --> 00:36:11.406
The universities declared

00:36:11.656 --> 00:36:16.870
that all STIC results from this
round are automatically invalid.

00:36:17.296 --> 00:36:20.828
The Education Commission
continues to investigate the

00:36:20.853 --> 00:36:23.703
cheating scandal and those involved.

00:36:38.632 --> 00:36:39.632
Hey, Pat.

00:36:46.049 --> 00:36:47.843
Whoa, look at that.

00:36:53.198 --> 00:36:54.991
So, have you sent in the application?

00:36:58.202 --> 00:36:59.202
I'm about to, Dad.

00:37:00.365 --> 00:37:01.365
What are you waiting for?

00:37:01.406 --> 00:37:02.344
You're good to go.

00:37:02.369 --> 00:37:03.369
Just do it.

00:37:08.338 --> 00:37:09.338
Dad,

00:37:09.964 --> 00:37:11.758
I need to talk to you about something.

00:37:15.219 --> 00:37:17.221
It's about the STIC.

00:37:17.758 --> 00:37:18.885
What's there to talk about?

00:37:18.932 --> 00:37:20.183
You'll just have to submit it.

00:37:20.183 --> 00:37:21.768
Something so simple.

00:37:30.372 --> 00:37:31.372
Dad, I cheated.

00:37:37.489 --> 00:37:38.489
What did you say?

00:37:40.348 --> 00:37:41.808
Did you say, cheated?

00:37:42.711 --> 00:37:44.087
I've always been cheating.

00:37:44.624 --> 00:37:46.209
The STIC results,

00:37:46.501 --> 00:37:47.524
my good grades,

00:37:48.826 --> 00:37:50.077
none of that was me.

00:37:50.989 --> 00:37:53.075
I've been paying someone
to give me the answers.

00:37:53.638 --> 00:37:55.181
What you saw on the news,

00:37:56.803 --> 00:37:58.012
I was part of that.

00:38:00.119 --> 00:38:01.954
This is some kind of joke, right?

00:38:02.892 --> 00:38:04.894
What nonsense is this, Patrick?

00:38:06.521 --> 00:38:07.522
Dad, I'm sorry.

00:38:09.362 --> 00:38:11.198
But haven’t you ever wondered?

00:38:11.899 --> 00:38:14.902
You've never even seen me study
and suddenly my grades shot up.

00:38:19.283 --> 00:38:20.660
I can't believe this.

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:23.246
You're an embarrassment.

00:38:23.246 --> 00:38:25.039
You were so arrogant in that interview.

00:38:25.284 --> 00:38:26.297
My god,

00:38:27.078 --> 00:38:29.455
I gave you everything you needed,

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:34.068
I gave in to all your luxuries
and this is what I get in return?

00:38:39.325 --> 00:38:40.625
Dad, I'm trying my best.

00:38:42.487 --> 00:38:45.156
But honestly, I don't want to go to BU.

00:38:47.442 --> 00:38:49.736
I'm struggling with your expectations.

00:38:51.169 --> 00:38:52.169
I could—

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.900
I could never be like you.

00:38:57.218 --> 00:38:58.218
No,

00:38:59.052 --> 00:39:01.012
but you are a Tioseco.

00:39:01.437 --> 00:39:04.899
And you will graduate
from Boston University.

00:39:05.092 --> 00:39:08.345
You will retake the STIC and get,

00:39:08.814 --> 00:39:13.046
by studying, the high
marks that you got before.

00:39:13.463 --> 00:39:14.297
Or else...

00:39:14.297 --> 00:39:15.923
Or else you'll do what, Dad?

00:39:16.611 --> 00:39:19.447
Whatever I do, I am never enough for you.

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:22.446
Do you think

00:39:22.471 --> 00:39:24.149
my world revolves around you?

00:39:24.954 --> 00:39:26.392
I am my own person.

00:39:29.233 --> 00:39:30.234
You silly,

00:39:30.771 --> 00:39:32.356
stupid boy.

00:39:32.388 --> 00:39:34.556
You are nothing without me.

00:39:34.581 --> 00:39:37.189
Everything you have came from me,

00:39:37.214 --> 00:39:39.243
don't you ever forget that.

00:39:40.214 --> 00:39:41.892
Well, I'm done living off with you.

00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:43.899
I can do this on my own.

00:39:44.856 --> 00:39:46.315
Cut me off, throw me off.

00:39:49.082 --> 00:39:50.124
I don't care anymore.

00:39:51.542 --> 00:39:52.710
Well, neither do I.

00:39:53.207 --> 00:39:55.167
See if you can survive without me.

00:39:55.192 --> 00:39:56.204
Go ahead.

00:39:56.589 --> 00:39:58.091
Go ahead and fail!

00:40:09.852 --> 00:40:10.852
Hon.

00:40:12.847 --> 00:40:13.855
What?

00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:19.901
Oh my god, look at this mess.

00:40:21.081 --> 00:40:22.782
Pat, you just moved in here

00:40:22.782 --> 00:40:24.784
and this place already looks trashed.

00:40:25.243 --> 00:40:26.277
Hon, seriously,

00:40:26.452 --> 00:40:27.995
are you going to yell at me too?

00:40:29.413 --> 00:40:31.582
You need to be more responsible.

00:40:31.874 --> 00:40:34.043
You don't have a nanny,
you have no credit cards,

00:40:34.043 --> 00:40:34.811
nothing.

00:40:34.836 --> 00:40:35.878
I know, but

00:40:35.878 --> 00:40:39.006
I still have savings and
earnings from our STIC.

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:41.134
We're good, hon, relax.

00:40:41.134 --> 00:40:44.220
And all evidence connecting
us to STIC is already deleted.

00:40:45.113 --> 00:40:46.135
We're clean.

00:40:49.794 --> 00:40:51.755
Okay, maybe.

00:40:52.353 --> 00:40:54.147
Maybe this isn't a good idea.

00:40:54.397 --> 00:40:56.357
You know,
maybe I should just go home.

00:40:58.257 --> 00:41:01.302
We should just apologize
to your dad so this is over.

00:41:06.075 --> 00:41:08.786
I'd rather go broke than go back to my dad.

00:41:16.669 --> 00:41:19.338
My dad found out about the STIC tests too.

00:41:20.481 --> 00:41:22.609
You know, good thing the
news didn't even mention our

00:41:22.633 --> 00:41:23.985
printing press company.

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:26.345
You know, I'm pretty much
a prisoner back at home.

00:41:27.346 --> 00:41:28.848
I sneaked out.

00:41:32.894 --> 00:41:33.894
Hon,

00:41:34.145 --> 00:41:35.145
we're together anyway.

00:41:37.106 --> 00:41:38.106
We can do this.

00:41:41.694 --> 00:41:44.071
By the way, did Bank message you earlier?

00:41:45.364 --> 00:41:46.364
Message me?

00:41:46.782 --> 00:41:47.782
About what?

00:41:48.117 --> 00:41:49.117
Check your phone.

00:41:49.456 --> 00:41:50.456
The gang is back.

00:42:07.551 --> 00:42:09.379
Bank, what’s this?

00:42:11.057 --> 00:42:12.057
What’s going on?

00:42:13.937 --> 00:42:17.274
Are we still here to talk about
what's happening in STIC?

00:42:17.715 --> 00:42:19.023
I also saw the news.

00:42:20.647 --> 00:42:22.315
You have no information about that.

00:42:24.423 --> 00:42:25.449
Anyway,

00:42:25.561 --> 00:42:26.645
we're good, Lin.

00:42:26.862 --> 00:42:28.270
No one’s coming after us anymore.

00:42:28.658 --> 00:42:30.535
No reruns, no retakes.

00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:32.286
That’s the clients’ problem now.

00:42:33.614 --> 00:42:34.388
And

00:42:34.413 --> 00:42:38.960
our dads found out about the STIC
tests but they're not calling the cops.

00:42:41.409 --> 00:42:42.426
That's how it should be.

00:42:44.027 --> 00:42:46.571
Because if they’re good
parents, they’ll protect you.

00:42:48.552 --> 00:42:49.434
But Lin,

00:42:50.469 --> 00:42:52.470
we’re not here to talk about STIC.

00:42:53.069 --> 00:42:54.321
We need your help.

00:42:55.557 --> 00:42:56.766
We have a new plan.

00:43:05.298 --> 00:43:06.489
Let me just remind you.

00:43:06.993 --> 00:43:09.700
This isn’t like before
where I’d just give answers.

00:43:09.748 --> 00:43:11.380
What we're doing is a crime.

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:13.278
Here are the five main processes.

00:43:13.309 --> 00:43:14.685
One, sampling.

00:43:15.243 --> 00:43:16.372
Actual printing.

00:43:16.843 --> 00:43:17.886
Quality assurance.

00:43:17.911 --> 00:43:19.016
Packaging.

00:43:19.041 --> 00:43:20.184
And dispatch.

00:43:20.209 --> 00:43:22.586
But security is really tight.

00:43:23.001 --> 00:43:24.689
They're super strict, right?

00:43:24.714 --> 00:43:27.925
But we just need an
inside man to work for us.

00:43:28.254 --> 00:43:29.235
Seems like

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:31.106
what you're asking me to do is hard because

00:43:31.343 --> 00:43:32.793
first of all, it's dangerous.

00:43:32.818 --> 00:43:34.403
Second, if my boss catches me,

00:43:34.595 --> 00:43:35.846
I’ll be done for.

00:43:35.871 --> 00:43:38.040
Even if we pay you 100,000.

00:43:39.226 --> 00:43:40.231
It's about time.

00:43:44.025 --> 00:43:45.661
We already put the phone in the food pack.

00:43:46.164 --> 00:43:47.762
We’re sending in the utility now.

00:43:49.739 --> 00:43:51.632
Where’s the food I set aside?

00:43:51.657 --> 00:43:55.036
I don’t know, maybe it all
got thrown away with the trash.

00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:57.793
Yes, the power is off.
