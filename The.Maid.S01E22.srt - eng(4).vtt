00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.600
It was you?

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.440
Prepare the horses.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.480
Head to the palace.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.344
Understood.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.400
By the Empress Dowager's decree,

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.320
Her Grace is unwell today.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.520
Your Highness,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.800
please return.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.760
I will remain here

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.000
and kneel until Her Grace recovers.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.080
Your Grace,

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.200
Ye Xiyan

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.880
actually knelt outside all night.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.920
The Prince Regent

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.280
accompanied her through the night.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.200
Good.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.480
She is indeed a useful pawn.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.000
Summon her.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.120
Understood.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.440
Consort Ye, don't worry.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.840
Zhao is being cared for

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.640
by my personal nanny.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.360
Your Grace,

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.520
Zhao is my own flesh and blood.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.640
As long as you spare him,

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.080
I'll do anything you command.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.640
You're clever enough

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.240
to understand

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.160
what I truly desire.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.160
Pei Ji...

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.960
Take his life.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.400
I'll let you leave with the child.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.360
Shen Yuanjin

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.320
will also be yours to handle.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.400
I await your success.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.880
I

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.224
will fulfill the task.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.320
Your Highness.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.640
The Empress Dowager claims

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.200
only surrendering
your military authority

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.800
can ensure Zhao's safety.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.280
Today,

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.800
I'll give you the tiger tally.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.320
All my actions

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.040
are to protect those I cherish.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.640
(Pei Ji,)

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.280
(turns out I never truly knew you.)

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.440
Your Grace,

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.760
Xiyan is an outsider, after all.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.200
I'm your blood relative.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.240
How could you trust her?

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.200
I care only for results.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.840
Kill Pei Ji,

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.840
and you'll be mother
to the Prince Paramount.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.400
You're my true niece by blood.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.920
Naturally, I wish to support you most.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.640
Since you're determined,

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.480
I'll share this with you.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.320
The four generals of the Western Army
intend to defect.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.480
I've promised them

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.000
that after our victory,

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.440
they'll be ennobled
as non-imperial princes.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.120
So you've already...

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.320
But confronting Pei Ji directly

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.200
makes them hesitant.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.480
Moreover,

00:06:50.688 --> 00:06:52.240
one of them still resents

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.560
your father's past mistreatment

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.520
of his family.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.640
Your Grace,

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.320

♪Wind comes but never stays by her side♪

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.800

to stay with my aunt these days?

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.440
Why return so abruptly?

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.720
It makes me miss

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.680
the Lantern Fair.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.600

Are you alright?

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.032
My lady, I...

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.520
The lady awaits.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.600
You're a maid?

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.120

I'll beg Madam for your freedom.

My family still has

You're about to wed the Prince Regent,

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.960
yet fall in love with this trash?

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.648
My lady,

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.800
it's all my fault.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:13.760
Yuanjin is innocent.

My lady.

Guards.

Castrate him.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.040
No. My lady!

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.640

- My lady!

00:10:27.584 --> 00:10:30.200
I was the one who got him drunk
and seduced him.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.120
It wasn't his fault.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.280
I have my own feelings too.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.720
I don't want to be your pawn
in a political marriage.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.480
Every action demands a price.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.480
Can you abandon the glory
of the Duke's Mansion,

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.800
and renounce your title
as Princess Consort

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.880
to become a mere guard's wife?

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.080
Jin,

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:05.560
I'll take you away.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.680
To somewhere nobody knows us.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.680
Though I can't offer you
current luxuries,

00:11:12.512 --> 00:11:13.480
I'll never let you

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.640
suffer even a little.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.320
That's just fine.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:49.600
This way,

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.680
you can accompany me

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.600
to the Prince Regent's Mansion
after my marriage.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.240
We'll stay together forever.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:17.824
Jin.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.320
Is this truly what you desire?

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.280
When Zhao becomes Prince Paramount

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.480
and obtains the ironclad edict,

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.200
we'll take him to Jiangnan.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.720
In that land of literary elegance

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.480
and gentle prosperity,
we'll live in honored peace,

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.280
never returning to the capital.
